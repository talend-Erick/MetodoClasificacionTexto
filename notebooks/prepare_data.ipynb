To me, an awful bed kills it for me. But the $20 massages made me feel better about my choice. Not sure if I'd come back because my back can't handle it.

If you closed the shutters however, the room was very dark. Maybe the rooms upstairs are better. The bed sheets were old and looked worn and they did not fit the double mattresses.

The shared bathroom was ok, and worked for showering and using the restroom. I loved the roof-top view and the hammocks. The location is very close to almost everything in Antigua, and walking to and from the center of town was a breeze. I'd say the stay was safe. The only downfall was the noisy patrons coming in late at night and we could hear people playing music on a rooftop for hours late into the night. Bring your shower shoes, because the shower is more of an industrial type. Value for the price? Excellent. If you are looking for a hostel environment, this is a great place to stay!\",\n",

The garden, swiming pool and saloon are also minimal.  The breakfast is 'a la carte' and it is correct.  In short, it is not worth the price it costs at all.
