I stayed for 3 weeks during the pandemic and was so impressed with all the measures the hotel have put in place to keep everyone safe and well. They give you a box of masks, gloves and a bottle of hand sanitiser upon arrival, all the staff wear masks and gloves and the rooms and everything else are cleaned to the highest standard.  Plus the prices they've been offering during this time are incredible value for money! Definitely would recommend and hope to be back once travel reopens.   Thank you so much for looking after me so well until I could return home!\",\n",
       "  'Everything about this hotel was awesome. The staff made me feel welcomed from the minute i arrived until the day i departed. The view from the dining area with the mountains in the background was spectacular. The grounds were manicured to perfection with flowering plants in every direction. In the center of the pool / courtyard area was the largest bougainvillea i have ever seen. It was blue and in full bloom. I estimate it was 40 feet plus in height.  Fresh flower arrangements in the reception and dining area. The room was well appointed, clean, and comfortable. I travel extensively for business and pleasure. This in one of the best hotels i have ever stayed at, truly an amazing experience. The city of Antigua is beautiful, with a grand plaza, preserved buildings and churches',\n",

Very relaxing, we feel pampered and don’t want to leave!',\n",

I never want to leave when I stay at Hotel Antigua',\n",

Even helped me take some of my stuff to the room when she didn’t have to. She also helped organize my shuttle back to Guate Airport. I got a king-sized bed with a balcony that overlooks the arch and street. Excellent place and was quiet at night so you can rest. Price was excellent for the services rendered. ',\n",

In fact given its central location, just about every attraction in the town is accessible by walk. The place is a cosy nook with few rooms. That said, you can almost have their little lounge to yourself when you want. The rooms are tastefully done with Guatemalan textile and clean. The bed was comfortable as well. The only issue I had was the lack of ventilation. The room window opened to the steps just besides the room that would compromise my privacy but as I had mentioned, there are few rooms and very less people in the property so it was fine. The highlight of the place is the breakfast cooked by the\",\n",

I hope to stay here again when I come back to Antigua!',\n",

Since most of our tours were early in the morning, we missed breakfast three out of the four nights, but each morning they prepared a simple breakfast (ham & cheese sandwich, fruits & OJ) to-go so that we wouldn't go hungry. Very accommodating and flexible.  // Amenities - Airport shuttle service ($10/person), available both to and from the airport. They can also arrange transportation to other cities if you ask in advance. - Wonderful outdoor terrace upstairs, especially in the early mornings and evenings when the weather is cool. - Simple breakfast & purified water - Great location (close to tourist hotspots)  Overall, would highly recommend!\",\n",

Our group members were completely satisfied with their stay. The service was exceptionally accommodating. Since our three nights occurred over a period of 10 days while we volunteered and visited in other cities, they allowed us to store extra luggage between our stays. The rooms are a bit tight but the beds are comfortable. Some rooms have one bed, others have two, and some have a private bath and some shared. We preferred the two bed private bath option. It s a small hotel, with possibly ten to 15 rooms maximum. The included breakfast was satisfactory with fresh fruit and toast. Also',\n",

Totally unpretentious the staff have a genuine desire to ensure your stay is memorable.  ',\n",

It’s sooo yummy and really fresh, don’t miss it! It’s so nice getting such an awesome breakfast while sitting at that beautiful green terrace watching the volcano „Fuego“. The cleaning-/breakfast-ladies are really friendly, they even make your bed every morning and they clean the bathrooms/showers perfectly. Thank you for your absolutely wonderful work! The girls at reception are always helpful and friendly, thank you guys!

The showers are nice and hot.  There is a lovely breakfast included in the rate. We would definitely stay here again!',\n",

The breakfast is huge and varied and you can eat it on the roof terrace overlooking three volcanoes.  This is not a party hostel, good for couples or those trying to relax.  Nice hammocks on the roof terrace.  We did laundry with them for Q5 per pound and it was back the same day.',\n",

I left cheese in the minibar refrigerator and  since I was coming back to pick up my loggage  , just with a phone call staff inmediately took care of it .   I order room service for breakfast and was willing to pay for it even though that our expenses covered the breakfast at the restaurante. They did not charge for taking my breakfast to the room .   Other activities that we had in the hotel  , where excepcional since they have gorgeous outdoor spaces  . I recommend Santo Domingo not only as a tourist but to have Seminars or forums because they have the capacity in managing small and big groups. ',\n",

The restaurant on top of the mountain was a divine experience all the way around.  The hotel was the best I've ever stayed in and the grounds, museums, pool, and art were fabulous beyond my expectations. We were very pleased and will try to return next year to do it again. The only complaint is minor and just needed to be mentioned to someone.The location of the hotel seemed safe and secure and the room was excellent. \",\n",
       "  'This was our first stay here, and it is a beautiful property. The grounds are lovely, and our room was well appointed and very very clean (be sure to get one with a window, patio or balcony). Be sure to take advantage of visiting the onsite museums and ruins.  The staff is very very friendly and service oriented. Food was good, but they need some more \"casual\" options at dinner. The property was expensive by Guatemala standards, but coming from the US, affordable luxury.  We also visited the restaurant and museum at Santo Domingo del Cerro, up the hill from the hotel and had a delicious breakfast and enjoyed wonderful art installations. ',\n",

It is located very conveniently close to the famous yellow Arch in Antigua and just down one block from the town square, shopping, banking and restaurants. You can't tell from the outside, but this small hotel has a beautiful courtyard with blooming plants, greenery and a pool. There is also a covered breakfast area that became our gathering place in the morning mostly because they had free coffee and cold water. Fortunately, our room was upstairs above the breakfast area. Even though there are stairs to haul your suitcases up and down, try to reserve room 10, 11 or 12. Those rooms have a balcony that you can watch Volcano Fuego erupt every night! There are several benches to sit on along the room\",\n",

They give you two bottles of water per day and I easily purchased more to use for cooking or brushing teeth etc, we had no issues as we stuck to bottled water. We ate at the restaurant a couple times, good food nice staff. We walked into town many times, it’s not far.

They do a lot of business with my company often so they already knew to have certain accommodations in place. The location is perfect. Two blocks close to the Arch, a few blocks close to Central Park and best a bunch of restaurants. Breakfast was delicious. Overall, I had a good stay. One suggestion.... Leave a night light at the entrance. My flight was at 6am so I had to leave at 4am. I was in room #18. I had to use the flashlight on my phone to find my way to the front.',\n",

The administration was helpful and available by text all the time. It was wonderful to have a full kitchen and washer/dryer during our stay. The apartment was perfect for our stay. It is a little off the beaten track so was quieter than the center of town but easy waking distance to everything.',\n",
       "  'The apartment is located within walking distance to various attractions, restaurants and the happening places in Antigua. The apartment is beautifully decorated, and the cherry on the cake was a bunch of fresh flowers and a huge bowl of local fruits on the dining table. Very comfortable bed, bath and kitchenette. The washing machine and dryer are a blessing, after one has been travelling through the Peten jungles. There is ample parking for your vehicle and security at the front gate. All-in-all, a perfect stay.',\n",

When I stay here I know that I only need go to Central Park to find the street - no turns to remember.  When you are there get out and explore, there are so many places to see and you should not feel you have \"seen\" Antigua by just going to two churchs, a ruin and a market.   I don\\'t always want to go out for breakfast, or dinner for that matter - and the Marques has a well equipped (with modern appliances!) kitchen so I can make meals or heat up my leftovers  if I want to, units also have a washer and dryer so I can do laundry.

Then you have to knock to get inside. This is not a bad deal for anyone staying there. The room was spacious and comfortable. I was on the second floor so if you have a heavy bag this could be a little difficult. The room had a comfortable bed, tv, bathroom, and a great view. The whole hotel area is a big garden. They also include breakfast, which is a perk. Eggs, beans, cheese, bread, and coffee for a delicious breakfast.',\n",

This adds to the style however as the rooms are wonderful and filled with character (ours even had a little show fireplace)   2 blocks from the main plaza and with very helpful staff (Nery was very attentive) I'd recommend choosing this hotel if you are in Antigua.   Breakfast was a little limited , but enough to get you through to lunch. Everyone was friendly.   The rooms were clean as was the hotel , and there is a rooftop view of Antigua where you can see Fuego spewing lava at night.   Really enjoyed our stay here. Stayed 6th to 8th of March \",\n",

It is probably a 3 to 3.5 star small \"hotel\", rustic, with a great location in the middle of town, close to all must see sites. Breakfast was very limited (scrambled egss, beans and one type of white cheese). But good value ',\n",

While most of the staff spoke little English the manager who was present each day was fluent.  The manager gave us information on tours and shops.  Breakfast was relatively simple but good.  Our room was not very large but was well outfitted and the bed was comfortable.  We had no issues with hot water (there was plenty).Ask for a second floor room, they have  view of Fuego ( an active volcano).   There were no negatives during our 4 night stay.  The hotel is a bargain.  We would stay there again. Stop for diner and music at the Santa Clara Cafe only a block away.',\n",

The rooms and lounge are decorated with antique style furniture. ',\n",

My room was also gorgeous- every detail was beautiful. Even the doors were carved with a floral design. The staff is very helpful.  The less good things: I got about 90 seconds of hot water for 2 out of 3 showers. There was neither a/c nor a fan.  Merely irritating things: the front door is locked, so every time you come back to the hotel, you have to knock and hope someone heard you. Also, it's a little ways from the central part of town, but it's a small town, so that's only about 10-15 minutes of walking.\",\n",

My boyfriend and I had a junior suite on the second floor with a great view of the volcano when we stepped outside our door.The room was clean, had great natural light and a fireplace. King sized bed was comfortable and actually big enough for my 6'3'' boyfriend to fit in. WiFi signal strength in rooms was strong. Location was great. Within walking distance from the central park and the walk home late at night never felt un-safe. The staff was incredibly friendly and always willing to help with directions and/or advice. The breakfast in the courtyard/garden every morning was fantastic! Great choice for the price.\",\n",

I would recommend this place to my family and friends.  The only issue is, the morning and afternoon traffic from Antigua to GUA can be quite heavy, up to two hours.  Keep this in mind with flights, as I missed one of mine.  ',\n",

It's quaint, quiet and relaxing but you also have access to the larger resort across the street so can enjoy some additional amenities like restaurant, bar and pool (but Casa Encantada also has a pool!). The room was small but we never spend much time in the room when exploring a new city so that doesn't matter. It was well decorated and comfortable. The staff were all very friendly as well! The breakfast on the rooftop was also delicious and it was so nice to soak up the sun on the rooftop every morning. You can pretty much walk all of Antigua so the location is perfect and not on a super busy street. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Antigua!\",\n",

It’s a great place from which to launch a walking circuit of all the sites in the city and is very close to a square where a (cooked) food market bustles at night. Plenty of tiendas for essentials like wine and snacks too.   As for the property, it is just lovely. Pass through a locked gate to a gorgeous small colonial courtyard with a small fountain.

They helped us with whatever we needed and answered all our questions. The daily breakfast is served to order and in a room next to the kitchen with five tables. Although the choices are limited to either the traditional eggs, beans, cheese and fried plantains or the pancake and fruits platter, it was something that we looked forward to and enjoyed.

Breakfast (included) consists of 2 eggs, black beans, fried plantains, and 2 roles (and coffee or juice).  We had to leave early twice, so we had breakfast 3 times at its lovely dining area.  Very satisfying.  When people have dinner in the courtyard, the noise comes right into your room, but normally they leave by 9 PM.  2 bottles of water replenished daily. \",\n",

Casa Encantada is a gem of a boutique hotel in the boundaries of the city and within walking distance to everything in Antigua de Guatemala.  I could imagine traveling back to Spanish colonial times with each turn in my strolls in the hotel and in the lobby.  First impression is superb followed by more of the same! Augustina served us breakfast after each of three nights in a second floor terrace overlooking a gorgeous garden paradise. This was luxury at its best; serene, tranquil and delicious in every way. The street noise was noticeable; however, not cause for concern.  The accommodations are also luxurious and the beds very comfortable. TV reception is not good.  SO DON”T watch TV when you should be outside',\n",
       "  'We stayed in Casa Encantada for 3 nights and enjoyed every single minute of it.  The room was beautiful and clean, the staff was incredibly kind and made sure we were taken care of from the moment we arrived. The breakfast in the terrace was great, and they also helped us book a massage at the Ceiba Spa. They will also coordinate transportation from and to the Guatemala City airport at a reasonable price. We would definitely stay there again when we go back to Antigua next year.',\n",

You also have complimentary tea and biscuits on the common area. There's also a small pool and the breakfast is served on the rooftop terrace. Breakfast was good with plenty of options to choose from and an amazing freshly baked bread! A very charming hotel. We loved it!\",\n",
       "  'Our room was quite spacious, next to the communal area and kitchen. The room was cleaned and tidied daily, Close proximity to the bus station and right next door to the largest supermarket in Antigua. Just a couple of blocks and within easy walking distance of the Central Plaza. Some noise from the communal area on occasion but generally a very quiet stay. There are several roof areas to relax in. Staff friendly and helpful. Wi-fi was excellent. No restaurant in the hotel, but many nearby.',\n",
       "  'Comfortable stay at Posada Don Valentino.  Our second stay at this hotel, and we will continue to return.  The rooms are a good size, beds are comfy, and the rooms and bathrooms are always clean.  Great location in Antigua, easy to get to any part of the city.',\n",

The hotel had good and bad points.  * Location: The hotel’s location is ideal--less than one block from Central Park, which the whole town revolves around.   * Staff: Extremely polite, helpful, accommodating, and friendly.  * Architecture: The hotel’s interior space is gorgeous, with a Spanish Colonial style, open-air courtyard and hallways.   * Rooms: The rooms are a little dreary; definitely less spectacular than the public areas.  They could use some fresh paint and less shabby furnishings.  The worst thing about the rooms are the truly awful travel posters dotting the walls.  The posters are cheap and in shoddy frames.  The place would instantly look so much better without',\n",

Our breakfast included eggs made the way we each like them, fresh fruit, yogurt, granola, hot coffee, juice, and warm bread. The views of the volcanoes from the rooftop lounge areas was incredible. There are courtyard style sitting areas all throughout this hotel, with open roofs/walls, filled with flowers and Guatemalan art. We spent hours lounging in the courtyard looking at our pictures and chatting about the highlights of our trip.\",\n",

El Meson de Maria is  at the center of everything!.    This hotel is very clean and  incredibly charming, and decorated just right for Antigua!   The only thing we would of liked was for our room to be a bit bigger, and the bathroom updated.      Having said that, we highly recommend for anyone to stay at this hotel.',\n",

The staff was also wonderful, with good English skills.   My room was right off the main courtyard. It was very quiet until about 6:30 AM when they start setting up breakfast. As I was already awake, this wasn’t an issue. You can hear street noises until about 9 pm when it starts quieting down.   The room itself was great. Bed was a tad bit on the harder side, but not a big deal. Pillows were soft and fluffy. Plugs in several spots in the room. Window opens to provide some ventilation. Given that I was right off the main courtyard, I opted to close it at night.   Bathroom was a nice size, with plenty of space for toiletries. Two',\n",

Flowers everywhere and a dreamy collection of tranquil courtyards and spaces to relax, including, what has to be, one of the best roof terraces in the city.

The staff were very attentive and friendly.  Thoughtful touches everywhere. An added surprise was complimentary afternoon tea in the courtyard!',\n",

AND - wander up to the terrace with your coffee on a clear day and get STUNNING 360 degree views of the city of Antigua and three volcanoes. The staff at the hotel were very lovely and accommodating. The hotel was very safe with all front doors closing at night and no one can enter unless a hotel guest. We plan to stay again on our next visit!',\n",

We saw the reviews on here so went to check the place out. We were pleasantly surprised to see a very pretty hotel set around a lovely garden. We had a look at a couple of rooms and they looked clean and comfortable. The owner was also very friendly and helpful. In the end our hotel had availability and pure lazyness stopped us from moving hotels for one night. I would, however without hesitation stay at this hotel if we were to come back to antigua.',\n",
       "  'Casa Noble is located in a renovated Spanish colonial mansion.  It has bright, comfortable rooms situated around a central courtyard with lovely gardens.  Our room on the second level  toward the back was quiet and had a beautiful view of the surrounding mountains.  The price included a delicious breakfast.  The hotel management was very friendly and helpful--especially Claudia, who has excellent English skills.  Our extended family rented the entire hotel and enjoyed a wonderful stay!',\n",

Delicious breakfast, unlimited filtered water and yummy coffee/tea served all day. Highly recommend!',\n",
       "  'We stumbled onto Hotel Casa Antigua at the last minute, as we were changing our travel plans. It is made from two adjoining, renovated colonial houses with high ceilings, antique touches (including a pulley to open/shut a skylight in room #5), and beautiful gardens/courtyards. The beds were comfortable, and--importantly for our family--there were multiple rooms with options for 3-4 beds. It is two blocks away from the central square and minutes from many great shops and restaurants. Although in general the hotel feels quite secluded from city noise, there were some modest issues due to the configuration of rooms opening to the courtyard. At late afternoon (and briefly in the AM), there is a huge flock of birds roosting and causing a ruckus in some of the trees in the courtyard.',\n",
       "  \"This is a centrally located hotel for people wanting a decent place to stay at a fair price in Antigua. We had two rooms and they were very different in size so worth asking for a spacious room when booking. The smaller room also smelt  very strongly of cleaning fluid but it did have a window and fan. The staff were warm and friendly. There was free water and tea/coffee on tap which we hadn't found in the more expensive hotels. My private bugbear is hotels charging you for bottled drinking water in small bottles so fair play to Casa Antigua which does not do this. There are lovely places to sit quietly and a shop selling local goods.\",\n",
       "  \"I loved staying here!  It was my first time in Antigua Guatemala, indeed in Central America; and while I loved the city, it was easy to escape back to our little oasis.  I stayed with my daughter and son-in-law in a spacious room with 2 double beds.  The room was clean and comfortable.  Our bathroom was down the hall, and there was never a problem with having to wait etc.  Great hot water!  We ate at the downstairs restaurant a few times, and it was always delicious.  Our room was close to the upstairs bar/restaurant, and we could hear music at night.  However it wasn't a problem as it wasn't too loud or too late... and the music was good!  Very central hotel, the beautiful Antigua is right on the doorstep!  I would definitely stay here again.\",\n",
       "  'I stayed here for my first and last nights on my trip to Guatemala so I was in 2 different rooms. Both rooms were great. I had no problems! Beautiful hotel! I love the outside sitting areas and the rooftop! Also right downtown in Antigua, walking distance to everything!',\n",
       "  'I would concur with all the positives about this hotel, i.e., cleanliness, convenience of location, breakfast, etc. We did not meet the owner, but rather dealt with a young lady who was new to the area, so the fact that she spoke English, did not help us much in answering local questions. The other receptionist did not speak English. She was on duty when we checked out so I was unable to resolve the $100 overcharge on our bill until I returned home. It was eventually resolved with a series of emails. If it weren’t for this uniquely negative experience, I would return to this hotel and recommend it to others. However, with so many hotels, we decided to choose another when we returned at the end of our vacation. It was not nearly as nice and more expensive.',\n",
       "  'Location, location, location. This place is excellent. We were warmly welcomed by a really friendly receptionist. He was very helpful about the local area and activities available. The rooms were clean, comfortable and well presented. Satellite tv available with English speaking channels available. The bathroom was small but adequate with free toiletries. There is a beautiful terraced area where breakfast is served. Breakfast was fantastic. I cannot recommend this place enough. There is also a nice coffee shop underneath where you have to enter for the hotel reception.',\n",

I\\'m happy to say that my eight night stay at Casa Del Arco made this my best trip ever.  When we arrived, after a long flight, Raphael the owner was on hand to greet us. He stepped out of the entrance and made us feel welcomed. He grabbed our two large suitcases and away we went. Check in was a breeze. He even carried our luggage upstairs for us. He was willing to help us with whatever we needed.  We had the \"Zebra\" room. It is a large upstairs room with a king bed, which was made by shoving two beds together. The room was nicely appointed and clean as a whistle. The room has a set of two french',\n",

There is a menu but after a few days we asked for some variation and Annie happily complied. There are just five guestrooms. The terrace is a wonderful place to just hang out. Everyone who works there is super helpful and nice and the location could not be better. I would totally go back there',\n",

I stayed in room 15 which has a king size bed and a private balcony with a view on the street and a volcano. The property is well maintained, has a nice pool and inner garden. Good value for money! Next door is El Barrio a traditional complex with 5 different bars. Mind that if you stay in room 15 that you will hear some faint music till around midnight. After that it’s quiet. In the other rooms I guess you are fine. We didn’t mind it, at all, it even gave some charm, guess we are city people :)',\n",

The grounds are lovely, with a nice pool, beautiful birds, lots of greenery, and volcano views. The rooms are comfortable and even have a terrace or balcony to sit and enjoy your surroundings. The restaurant and bar provide a great atmosphere and quality meals and the massages at the spa are wonderful. Everywhere we wanted to explore in Antigua was in walking distance, too. Antigua is such a great place to visit and Porta made it even better by giving us a relaxing vacation vibe. ',\n",

In fact, to call it a hotel is in part a disservice, because that belies the beauty and history that pervades every corner of the expansive property. It’s like staying in an ancient ruins yet with the comfort and service of today. Surprises abound, including thousands of flickering candles nightly, to fresh coffee and pastry discreetly placed in each hallway nook each morning.  The employees are top notch as well, from the initial bell stand interaction, to reception, restaurant, gym, housekeeping, security...you get the picture. All for less money than I would have expected.  I would return to Antigua again, in large part to stay here',\n",

Someone pointed out earlier that their slusing door wouldn't lock.  We found this to be true in our unit as well.  I ended up using the dustpan handle as a door lock, which worked alright.

We decided for this place because it is located just 4 blocks from the Central Park and several restaurants with all types of food. Our experience was much better than staying in a hotel.

The only cons I found are its location, it is a bit far from the center of antigua only because you have to walk everywhere and it rains alot. The other con is noise control.

Tourists must keep in mind that Antigua is a colonial city, you will not see signs over hanging the streets, the properties have names on them and this is how you locate them.  Although we entered Antigua during the night we were able to find El Marques quite easily, when we drove up the security guard checked a list to make sure we were on it before opening the gates to allow us to enter.

Don't worry, it's safe!  Actually there's no volcano view from the property, but it's the first thing you see when you go out. There's a small parking, I suppose it's free for guests. Warm shower only at low water pressure. Average breakfast (chapin, traditional).  If you want to take a shuttle you should know that it's more than probable that you'll be the first in the bus. Great, you can choose your seat... In return be prepared for 30min cobbled road ride to collect all the passengers from other hotels. If you are late, they'll probably come back in 30 mins ;)\",\n",

We had a taxi booked in the middle of the night on our 4th night, and the owners kindly let us leave bags with them all day and nap on their couch until it arrived so we didn't have to pay for an extra night.   Definitely stay here if you want to be out of the busy traveller hostels and really relax!\",\n",

Staff friendly and helpful...out of a gazillion hotels in Antigua this appears to be a reliable option, and we would return.

This hotel is old which adds to all the charm!

I have traveled extensively in Latin America and can say with confidence that this is one of the nicer accommodations in Antigua.

The hotel is immaculate and the courtyard is somewhere I could imagine sitting for hours.  It was just lovely and filled with trees, flowering plants, birds, and a fountain.

The rooms were clean and the showers had hot water. The Staff were very attentive and they took care of washing our clothes. Rafa, the owner, was very pleasant and helpful in arranging our transportation back to the airport and also offered some tapas for snacks.

As Posada offered this option and had availability - I booked - it was a GREAT DECISION.  The airport arrival can be overwhelming with the many taxi drivers lurking, and hoards of people waiting to welcome their family members. Our driver has a big clear sign and was an absolute delight!   The drive to Antigua is around 45 mins from the airport.

Every room is either lockable or they have lockers in the dorms, so all your valuables can stay safe.  A tip: if you take a bottom bunk in the dorm, you get privacy curtains :D They were fully booked on Halloween night so we unfortunately had to stay at another hostel for that night, but we came back and were welcomed like old friends.

The hotel is just blocks away from Park Central and close to the arch, as well.  It is a very well located hotel.   The hotel has a beautiful courtyard with a lovely fountain and each night around 5:30-6:00 o'clock the birds would arrive and serenade us.   The only drawback was that there wasn't always hot water.

The shower was odd and made me feel uncomfortable, but it was my fault for not complaining about it. I dealt with it for two nights being that I wasn’t there for the hotel, I was there to explore the area.

This time, we traveled with our one year old daughter, to whom the staff was very accommodating.  All staff members were very helpful (almost entirely in Spanish, but many were also apparently quite comfortable speaking a small amount of English).

It is a twenty minute walk to the plaza which I liked because we were close enough to go, but far enough away to feel more secluded. The food was amazing. The staff was always professional and attentive. The rooms are simple, yet always well maintained. When I say simple, I do not imply it lacks any modern conveniences. A good Latin hotel will have a hot shower, tiled floors and a comfortable and cable TV. I would stay here again in a heart-beat!',\n",

Since part of the hotel is set up like a hostel, there is no shortage of conversation in the outside common area with interesting guests.  I enjoyed watching a local artist paint wall murals near the bunk rooms.  There's also a beautiful garden near the private rooms, and you can catch a nap outside easily if so inclined.

       "  'We spent a week in Antigua, Guatemala with Casa Encantada as our domicile. We were very warmly greeted and impressed by the old world elegance of the Casa. It was well kept and very nicely appointed. Our room was essentially in a garden with fountains, plants and singing birds. We had a comfortable bed and well appointed bathroom. Though there were times in the morning when the commuter traffic was a little noisy, our stay was comfortable and relaxing. Most of all, the staff was very pleasant and helpful. I have no problem in recommending Casa Encantada.',\n",
       "  \"Our trip was to hike Acatenango and we wanted a room that would be comfortable and convenient. We ended up with so much more! The room was clean and comfortable. Nothing flashy but well appointed and everything worked well. The surprises were the second floor terrace with the included breakfast (every morning) and the friendly staff. The terrace was a great place to relax and enjoy breakfast, the sunshine, relax, and/or read.  Everyone was so nice. We were always greeted with a smile. The hotel is convenient to the center of the city. They also can plan spa's at the much more expensive hotel across the street. So even though they did not have their own spa, it was almost better as we did not have to pay the higher hotel prices. Also, if your into yoga, there is a great studio\",\n",
       "  'This a a quaint hostel in Antigua that was exactly what we were hoping for when we arrived. The staff is very helpful and kind. They even held our large suitcases when we went on a trip outside Antigua for a few days. Great hostel in this process range.',\n",

Don’t expect to meet traveling companions here, though. Maria is extremely helpful, with suggestions on where to eat, bank, shop and take Spanish language classes. ',\n",
       "  'We stayed in the double room with private bath, and could not fault Hostal Antigua. We also organised several shuttles with the hotel, all of which we found easy, reliable and economical. The staff are wonderful, and even let us check I. early (lucky us) at 10.30 am, after a long overnight trip from Flores (I did let them know this in an email if you’re thinking this sounds good)!  Would definitely stay there again, considering how clean it was, and the hot shower, comfy bed + great price!  ',\n",
       "  'It was clean and the staff is very nice. Not all of them speak english perfectly but for me as a non Spanish speaker it was still easy and nice to communicate. The location is just fine with breakfast, lunch and dinner options around the corner. It also has a night guard on duty, opening the front door for you when coming “home” late. You can pay cash and with credit card which is not very common in Guatemala. Would go there again.',\n",

There are some lovely touches , making one feel as though one is staying in a private home....and the welcome is warm and friendly. The roof terrace is great for relaxing. Breakfast was tasty and well  prepared . A hotel to recommend. ',\n",
       "  'The staff here are very friendly and efficient although a slightly more lively greeting each time you come in to the hotel would give an even better impression. It’s a really quaint hotel with beautiful flower arrangements all over.  The breakfast is served in the pretty courtyard - great muesli , fruit, yogurt and hot food.  From the rooms it’s really easy to hear people next door and bells ring nearby at 5am but it’s an old building so it’s all part of the ‘charm’.  From the roof you can see the volcano spewing its smoke at times. The hotel is in a good location with easy access to all the main sites.  We thought there was a bar downstairs but there wasn’t. However they sent out for some! ',\n",

The crisp bed linen, the airy bathroom with a glass ceiling so you can see the blue sky when you are having a shower. The packed breakfast when we left at six for a trip out. The coffee and cake served at 5pm. The tables , chairs and sofas dotted around the terraces for comfort. The extra mile that staff took in booking us transfers and tours. Thank you so much for a lovely stay. Helen and Bill, Feb 2019',\n",
       "  'The Euro Maya Hotel is easily the best hotel in Antigua, Guatemala. The interior decorations are incomparable and give the entire hotel a quaint, homely vibe. The staff is amazingly accommodating and rapidly responds to any requests. Both the staff and the hotel never fail to make you feel welcome. The food in the pleasantly sized restaurant on the upper level is superb; perfect portions, great taste, and filling just enough. The maids always clean the rooms in a timely manner and do the sweetest little things like folding the clothes and towels that were left on the floor. The best part of the hotel is the open roof which you can see from the lobby; some rooms have balconies so you can look up and see the sky. The hotel also includes a lounge/dining area with a huge waterfall',\n",
       "  'As this place is so similar to their sister property, Euro Maya Suites, you may see a lot of similarity in reviews.  I returned to Antigua and decided to try this, the older sister, as it was only half a block from The Plaza.  A beautiful small hotel with an excellent staff and nice rooms.   With all the knick-knacks around it could also be a museum. The quirky intermingling of Mezoamerican artifacts and photos of European cities is strange; depending on how you look at it you may consider it charming or annoying.  My room was above average size and comfortable although there was only one somewhat easy chair, and no sofa, so two people would have some difficulties when it came to relaxation. The bathroom was adequate and it had hot water in the shower without having bare wiring',\n",

It is a lovely hotel and the rooms are clean, bright and roomy. The staff is very friendly and although we had to wait some time for the room to be cleaned after we checked in it was well worth it. Aside from this the location, the prize was very reasonable!',\n",

Breakfast to go was arranged for our trip to the volcano, including his great Argentinian empanada's :). Rooms are clean, spacious and cool with a comfy bed and separate wifi for each room. Tasteful breakfast in the lovely quiet patio. Definitely a great place to go in Antigua (actually it was the nicest casa we stayed in Guatemala), highly recommended! Thanks Rafa :)\",\n",

We stayed in room 5 which would be great for a family - bunk beds in one room and two queens in the main room.  Room 5 is located in the back of the hotel making it very quiet.  We did not hear any noise from the street.  The upstairs terrace is very peaceful and comfortable, a very enjoyable place to hang out.  When the sky is clear, there is a nice view of the volcano.  Breakfast was very good, served to your liking.',\n",

The location is excellent-- just steps from the central square, the beautiful Arch, restaurants and shopping!  Rafael (the owner) was the most pleasant, accommodating, helpful person and literally went over and above to make us feel at home and attend to our needs!  We were on a medical mission and needed sack lunches each day and he had them ready by 6:00 am and packed in his children's lunchboxes to keep them cool!  He even called us one night on the phone to let us know that the volcano was erupting because he knew we didn't want to miss it!

It was very spacious and the beds were comfy, even the bunk beds.  The room was also spotless.  The family room was a bit noisy. It worked ok for us since we are early risers but if you want to sleep in I would recommend selecting a different room. I was also expecting a bit more from the private patio.  Unless you need the extra space I would recommend getting a room with a balcony on 5th.   The breakfasts were delicious with an excellent selection.

The hotel is very centrally located, within a few steps to the central park (where many restaurants, cafe's and shops are located) and artisanal markets. The staff were very friendly and helpful, directing us to the best place to exchange money, and helped us to arrange transportation to the airport. The pool was great - very refreshing and so appreciated after a day of sightseeing. The upper level has a great view of nearby ruins and the volcano, but we had a room on the lower floor and it was still great, with a view into the courtyard filled with plants and a fountain.\",\n",

It had everything I needed to be comfortable and the fan kept the room cool even without air. The room was very clean and was very close to the water tank to refill bottles. I loved everything about Casa del Parque but the thing I loved the most was the staff. They let someone else drop my bags off and took them to my room since I couldn't get there to check in til late. The gentleman at the front desk designed a safe morning running route for me and gave me other suggestions of active things to do and a lovely lady at the front desk helped me book a shuttle back to the airport effortlessly. The ambiance was perfect and for once on a vacation\",\n",

The price was quite reasonable compared to other hotels in the area. Breakfast was continental but for the price I paid I didn't expect a feast. Wifi only worked in the courtyard, the signal was too weak in my room. All in all, a great stay.\",\n",

It is just 2 blocks from the main square and there is traffic, but we kept our windows closed and weren't disturbed. We were offered a cooked, or continental breakfast (which is included in the rate) and ate on their very pretty patio.   We heard no noise from other rooms and my only gripe would be that the bedrooms need more illumination. Hopefully they could do that tastefully without breaking up the colonial decor.   If you are considering this property, be aware that they have a sister hotel called the Palacio Chico 1940, so don't book the wrong hotel. Don’t know why this property sits so low in the TA listings, it is a good option for travelers\",\n",
       "  'We stayed here on our final night in Antigua the staff could not have been nicer they answered loads of questions for us and sorted an airport shuttle. The room was spotless and the shuttered windows ensured a solid nights rest. It is a little expensive for what you get in terms of breakfast which was only 2 pieces of toast, 2 small slices of watermelon and pineapple. We asked for eggs which they gave.   Bottled water was free and it is in a nice quiet area of the town. ',\n",

If location is your primary concern, this may not be your best option. I would still give this place 5 stars because of the helpfulness of the staff.   We arrived in the evening and had a 4am shuttle to Honduras the next day so our time here was limited, but the staff were so friendly and ordered a Chinese delivery (Restaurante Mulan) for us for dinner. The room was also comfortable and the shower was a perfect temperature - important after a few days in the Guatemalan highlands where the water was lukewarm at best! This place was ideal for a short stay.',\n",

The hotel del Marques features exclusively suites, we booked a large suite for 6 persons equipped with a kitchen,  and a washer & dryer all of which proved very useful!  The beds were new and very comfy, even the sofa-bed seemed good quality (my kids slept in it, not me though) The hotel is quiet, we couldn't hear any of the other guests, however the design of the suite is such that you'll hear from the bedroom located\",\n",

Excellent beds and everything is clean. The hotel looks like it could have been a Spanish Estate and then turned into a hotel. I had dinner there and breakfast. Excellent food and attentive restaurant staff. The restaurant looks over the garden area, nice touch. Its about a 15 minute walk to the town. This is a very pleasant walk past old churches and lots of old buildings and shops. What a beautiful town. It looks like they dropped a Spanish city in Guatemala.',\n",

Kudos to the hotel for improving the museums, which are really interesting and worth a visit whether or not you stay at this hotel.  However, the food and room were not too impressive- three stars.  The room smelled smoky as there was a fireplace and a little card that instructed people not to have fires... well, then maybe you should take out the wood of the fireplace so that people do not light fires!  We had two meals at the hotel- an average breakfast with very slow service and sandwiches at the pool, which were not very good. All in all, an enjoyable 2 days, but the hotel could do better.',\n",

The staff is helpful and the property itself is gorgeous having left many of the original walls from the monastery. They've done an incredible job with the grounds full of plants and even parrots who hang out in the courtyards during the day. The restaurant is good but expensive for Antigua (as is to be expected with a hotel restaurant). I highly recommend staying here!\",\n",

As soon as you walk in, you understand that you are somewhere special, especially when you walk in at night. Almost mysterious, the candles, the sculptures, the patina, the history, a choice of music. It is like a museum where you were allowed to sleep. Staff is really great and friendly, however some of them did not speak English too well and it is strange given it is a 5 star hotel. On the same note the restaurant's staff is also very kind and really trying their best, but we had to wait for some silly things, that in theory shouldn't happen to a 5 star property. However, given it is Guatemala, we were totally OK with that. Apart\",\n",

There is a big wood door that is kept closed all day and night. But inside you will be presented by a huge garden very well taken care of. There is no parking. People are very attentive and always smiling. The room is very comfy, good bed, small tv that I did not try. In my room (19) there was 2 queen beds. My only complain is the shower, difficult to get to a constant water temperature. Sometimes too hot, sometimes colder. But nothing that bothered too much. I do',\n",

Guests can use the amenities of the other hotels, including meals, swimming pool and gym in the other hotels at no additional charge.  My room, while quite lovely, was directly on a noisy street.  I innocently asked if my room could be changed. The receptionist not only worked to change my room, but went the extra distance to see if I could be relocated to the other hotel.  This meant that I was upgraded to a much more luxurious room, at no additional charge.  This is what I call true customer service!  I ate several meals at the hotel--the Porta--including sumptuous breakfast buffets as two dinners, which were all exceptional.  A delightful experience, all in all.',\n",

We really appreciated this.   Our room (no 1) was small, quiet, comfortable and very well equipped but we would have liked a bit more shelf space for our belongings. The bathroom was large with an enormous shower area.  The hotel is conveniently situated, quite close to the Parque Central and it always felt safe walking to restaurants at night.

       "  'Nice place for a few nights!  Dorms have comfy beds, and there is a nice patio and kitchen on the roof.  Bathrooms could be a bit cleaner, but definitely workable.  Helpful staff as well.  They provide good lockers with a key.',\n",
       "  'Good location, clean and nice room, but not so big. Staff was unfriendly and unhelpful - additionally not speaking English. Hostel for people who like peace and quiet. Curfew in force since 22 hours. Generally a bit expensive.',\n",
       "  \"This hostel is really nice, with a massive courtyard with lots of seating and tables plus a beautiful garden. Rooms are clean, but bathrooms are pretty far in the back. It's a bit of a walk from the center... 10+ minutes, but seems to be on a peaceful, quiet street if you want to be away from the buzz. Great value for the money! We met friends in town so we didn't hang around the hostel too much to meet others. Owners are so sweet, they packed me a small lunch for my 4 AM shuttle!\",\n",
       "  'My fiancée and I loved this hostel. Our private, ensuite room was clean and lovely. The hostal has a view of a nearby volcano and serves excellent breakfasts included. It is very well located and has a nice climate. The Guatemalan owner, Christian, is a legend, speaks completely fluent English and Spanish and could not have been more helpful.',\n",

Very clean, very nice dorms and rooms (tried both), beautiful courtyard, delicious free breakfast, hot showers, close to everything. The family is very nice and helpful. We booked the Acatenango hike as well as a shuttle to Lake Atitlan with them and everything went smoothly. Highly recommend!!',\n",
       "  'Our stay at Hostal Antigueno was exactly what we wanted.  We stayed in a family room with private bath. The room had a queen sized bed and a set of bunk beds, which the kids loved.   The owner, Christian, speaks excellent English. He helped us book a tour to Pacaya volcano and also offer some great restaurant recommendations. The other staff aren’t as fluent but we were still able to get everything across that we needed.   The property is great. The hostal has its own garden and courtyard where you can just sit and relax and enjoy your free time.   The hostal allows guests to use their kitchen, so you can cook your own meals, or just cut up mangoes and pineapples like we did.   Our booking included breakfast. The options were pancakes or typical breakfast. Both were basic and',\n",

Excellent sized room, bathroom a little cramped and the shower head could do with being replaced (water really sprays out every which way), but nothing that stopped our stay from being very enjoyable.  Not the cheapest private room/bathroom in a hostel I've stayed in, but by far and away one of the best ones!  Staff/owners are lovely and very welcoming and helpful with information about the town, tours, hikes and shuttles/transfers...large resident dog is super sweet and friendly.  Loads of games and table tennis table and well stocked drinks fridge, but this is NOT a party hostel, don't stay there if that's what you're after...stay here if you don't mind being a little removed from\",\n",

I have been to Antigua several times, but this was my time at this hotel (which was recommended by a friend).  Everyone in my group had a great experience.  The staff (especially Jose) answered all our questions, the rooms were comfortable, and the location was excellent.  We had an early morning departure and since we left before the breakfast buffet, the staff packed food for us to take on the bus.  ',\n",

The hotel is central and offers only breakfast, the sticky muesli is very good, the service is a little nonchalant but you're on holiday so don't stress. There is a roof terrace which offers a nice view of the volcanoes.\",\n",
       "  'A lovely, quirkily elegant hotel with rooms leading off the internal courtyards and verandahs.  Our first floor room wasn’t that big, but was clean and comfortable with traditional colonial decor.  We found it quiet for sleeping at night.   The shower was really good - always a big plus for us.  Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is served in the beautiful courtyard full of ferns and flowers, which can be a bit chilly  (my follically challenged companion had to wear his woolly hat!) but we were told there was an unusually cold front coming through!  Not a huge choice of food, but the fruit was excellent, and the traditional breakfast of eggs, plantain, salsa and refried beans was nice.  The hotel is centrally located so it’s easy to walk to all areas of Antigua',\n",

The staff was very friendly and the location is super convenient (just around the corner from the Santa Catalina Arch and 2 blocks from the Central Park).   Our breakfast was included and consisted of pancakes, potatoes, yogurt & fruit. We had booked a double deluxe room and requested a quiet room and were placed on the second level in the back of hotel (room 208), which was perfect for us. Keep in mind there are no elevators here. Wifi was decent and from the rooftop you can spot the three volcanoes surrounding Antigua. I’d definitely recommend this hotel!',\n",
       "  'On the day of our departure, our taxi did not arrive by 4am. I got worried and asked the staff to call the driver. He spoke for a while on the phone, hung up and told me 5 min. When our \"taxi\" came, we realized that the owner Rafael himself had come to pick us up to take us to the airport! We are so grateful that he had woken up so early just to do us the favor! Thank you!  All the staff at Casa Del Arco are extremely friendly and helpful. A very helpful lady checked us in. On our departure day, even though it was 330am, a staff  was already awake and all ready to help me with my luggage.  Excellent wifi. Best we had in our 2 weeks in  Belize and Guatemala.  Hearty breakfast. I love the freshly squeezed OJ.  I love the terrace with comfortable couches where I spent my afternoons',\n",
       "  'We recently spent six nights in Casa del Arco and it truly felt like home. As we wandered into the b&b after 11 days of travel through the Yucatan and parts of Guatemala, our Agentinian host welcomed us with a greeting and a smile and helped us settle into marvelous spacious accommodations of solid wood,Guatemalan woven material, and sunlight. Throughout our stay he and his friendly staff truly made us feel at home and were helpful in every way.    There are four other reasons that I highly recommend Casa del Arco.  First of all, its second floor terrace with its hammock, swinging chair, sitting area and breakfasts-an excellent location to regroup after a day of exploration. Secondly, its bar and grill with a good selection of beers, tastey tapas, and awesome Agentinian sausage',\n",

We arrived late and our daughter, who had a bad stomach, hadn't eaten and was craving a soy-milk banana smoothie (she's a New Yorker, say no more). The lovely Argentinean host ran out to the supermarket, got soy milk and delivered a delicious smoothie to our room. So kind! Our family room consisted of a pristine, spacious room with two big double beds, a smaller room with bunk beds, and a bathroom. Comfortable beds, lovely white sheets, and so conveniently located right in the center of the city. Excellent value.\",\n",
       "  'We had 5 nights in this lovely hotel. It is managed by a wonderfully helpful, friendly, English speaking Argentinian host. As we struggle with Spanish this was a great help to us. Our room was large with a balcony that looked down on 5th Avenue. Excellent breakfast. Quality linen and towels and kept very clean by the great housekeeping staff. Wifi router in every room so best wifi connection we had anywhere in Guatamala .Very enjoyable stay, highly recommended.',\n",

Less than a block from the Central Park and two blocks from the Arc and Merced Church. Within walking distance of all historic sites. Rafa was a great host and his staff were incredible!!! Very clean rooms, great views from our balcony, and the patio where we enjoyed breakfast every morning. We will definitely return and stay at Casa del Arco. Thank you Rafa for a great week. ',\n",

I have no affiliation with either Hotel do not know the owners, but I did meet one of the owners once and she was very friendly. Somebody wrote that the rooms were the size of a broom closet where my half joking complaint about the Euro Maya Suites was it was such a long walk from the Master bedroom to the washroom as room 15 is enormous and is an actual suite with a king size bed and 60 inch flat screen for $50 US, Yes the rooms at the Euro Maya Hotel are smaller but they do charge less. to the reviewer that arrived on December 30th and complained about bait and switch, You arrived the day before New years Eve, you were lucky',\n",

The layout of the hotel is excellent.  There are two courtyards and since the hotel is smaller (only 19 rooms or so) you can easily find your way around.  There is a great lobby area, breakfast was served daily with our group (and was awesome) and the shopping, coffee shops, a gym, hostels and other interesting sites (old church buildings, market, etc) are all within 3 blocks.  The staff is outstanding.  They are always there when you need them but are not hovering too much!  Wifi is available and the restaurant/food service on site is excellent.

The beds with very comfortable with nice bedding and good pillows. Lovely flat screen TV's with Sky TV, so many many channels in English. Good, high speed internet. Not the strongest signal in our room, but excellent in the central courtyard.  A rooftop deck with some fabulous views. Not much furniture for sitting up on the roof deck.  The price included breakfast - traditional fare - eggs, beans, cheese, plantain, and toast.\",\n",

If you're looking for a pleasant spot to relax, then this is the place! They also offer delicious economical lunches and shuttle and tour services. We'll keep coming back here!\",\n",

The swimming pool is very clean and HEATED, which was great bonus since the temperatures where quite moderate in January. The staff of the hotel was amazingly welcoming, friendly and helpful. Thank you!!! Complimentary tea and coffee served 24 hrs is very nice. The staff even let us use the kitchen to prepare breakfast, which was also very nice. On our last day we decided to order breakfast in the hotel and it was very tasty, too. No restaurant, but there are many around. Right next door there is El Pinque - great place with nice local, atmosphere and HUGE portions of food for a reasonable price.',\n",

I then left my credit card in the taxi and the hotel called and had it back for me in the morning!!  Coffee was wonderful.  Pool and gardens looked wonderful but was so busy we didn't get a chance to try it out.  Room was large and full of character.  I love interesting, different places and this was one of my favorites.  Would definitely stay again.  Also great access to city center.\",\n",

It is a quiet oasis very close to the centre. The staff are the strong point and both the owner and the receptionists looked after me and were extremely kind, helpful and friendly. The rooms are clean, simple and comfortable, the wifi is a bit patchy but that is typical for Antigua. Breakfast is simple of toast, jam and fruit. It is good value for money and I would recommend this place to anyone for a traditional Antigua house to stay in. ',\n",

The rooftop patio was amazing at night for viewing the volcano and the lights of Antigua. I can’t wait to go back!',\n",

The entrance is authentic, with a patio and a fountain in the middle, and nice tables to catch the midday sun. It was a lovely surprise for us to discover the rooftop terrace and view on our last day, where we caught the sunset and a panoramic view of Antigua. Perfect for a couple of minutes of reading time or simply enjoying the time.   The hotel does not offer breakfast included, but you may request it. I recommend a delicious place less than a block away called Doña Luisa, where you’ll get both typical breakfast and international options.   The location is perfect, only a few blocks from the cathedral. Either way,',\n",

The rooftop sitting area offers a great view of town and the volcanoes. There aren't fridges in the rooms, but it was better to have the use of the communal kitchen, I think. When our ride to Guatemala City fell through, the staff found us another within 15 minutes. We felt very safe staying here, as well. Wifi worked fine.\",\n",

There's hot water all day and clean towels everyday if you need.  The kitchenette was fully equipped, which made it easy to fix light meals instead of getting takeout everyday.  All restaurants and a small supermarket are within walking distance.  The only downside...if party noise bothers you, not the base place to catch the best night sleep.  Since is so close to it all in Antigua main restaurants, the arch and parque central, you will catch the noise off the parties.  Mostly 'til 3am 😴😴 Other than that, we will be staying here the next second round to finish our Guatemala tour. 😉\",\n",

You can get better value by booking directly with the hotel so maybe bypass the online bookings.  the ladies at reception were welcoming and helpful, I enjoyed my stay.  They don't provide breakfast but there are many places along the road or in the town square, I guess that is what a posada is about...\",\n",

The beds and pillows comfortable, great WiFi, hot water, free drinking water, free coffee and tea. Beer for sale in cooler, cheap price. Nice courtyard and a top terrace with great views. Very secure. The best though is the staff was very friendly and helpful. The only down side, is that the terrace needs new cushions for chairs and to be more inviting, so much potential there. We would definitely stay there again. Oh ya and they store your stuff for you if you are coming back as we did after spending a week at Lago de Atitlan.',\n",

Sunday morning - 5:30am, 5:45am & 6:00am.  So if you are an early riser this place is just perfect. If not, you may need to stay further from the centre.',\n",

Clean bath towels daily, but only one hand towel and one wash cloth for 3 people.   The package had us away for two nights out of the week. The hotel staff charged $1 per bag for storage, which is ridiculous. They coordinate with the tour operator for the cost of the room, and knew we would be out for two separate nights, and still charged us. The menat the front desk were apologetic.

The rooms are clean, comfortable and there is a laundry service at the hotel (also very expensive compared to local rates)',\n",

Its in a quiet part of town with all rooms on two levels surrounding a very pleasant internal courtyard. The roof top is large and has some seating and tables - great for some late night drinks looking at the volcano under the stars. The rooms are reasonable size with good facilities - a great shower and bed. We did not have breakfast included so went out each morning (there are some great options nearby. The property does not have a restaurant. The reception seems to be manned 24/7 and sold a small range of essentials and drinks. The property fees very secure with a door that is locked late evening.

The description says it is two blocks south of the central park square, but it is almost a four block walk.  The main door is kept locked at all times, and you have to ring a bell for entry.

The place seemed quite secure as the front doors were locked at all times and you had to buzz to get in. We originally had a room by the roadside and it was a bit noisy in the early morning, but we were able to change rooms given it was low season. The hot water works, but requires a bit of patience. Bottled water provided daily was appreciated. The location was good - walking distance to Parque Central and Caobo Farm. Overall, a good hotel and we had a comfortable stay.',\n",

Everywhere there were antiquities on display. Candles lit the grounds at night. The furnishing scattered around the hotel all were worth looking at closely.

The Casa Encantada is pretty well placed in Antigua. I highly recommend this hotel if you are searching for something with the Guatemalan charm ! You won't be disappointed 😊\",\n",
       "  'especially the new connection to porta hotel Antigua. Its a plus to be able to use their pool and gym/dining as well.   Casa Encantda is well located - .  Clean rooms - pleasant size - makes this an obvious choice every time!  Great for small groups - The ONLY recommendation is to change doorbell ring - so, it doesnt sound throughout hotel every time someone is entering hotel.  ',\n",

We decided to book the Suite for the rest of our stay and it was the best decision ever! Casa Encantada feels intimate and romantic, it\\'s located a couple of block away from the center and just around the corner from the large hotel Porta in case you want to make use of the heated pool and spa. The suite is was spacious and beautifully decorated, we made use of the hot tub and the chimney twice and had breakfast on the terrace while enjoying the beautiful views. We were able to use the terrace during our \"getting ready\"',\n",

       "  'When we arrived at Hostal Antigueño, we were instantly impressed with the property. We were greeted within 30 seconds by the Owner/Operator named Christian, and he is the nicest guy in town. The atmosphere of the Hostel was definitely more relaxed the first night (Thursday), and the crowd picked up for the Friday/Saturday nights. However, it’s definitely NOT a typical “party“ Hostel. They do have a wide selection of cheap and delicious beers, and it’s a great vibe for hanging out but we always got a great night sleep as it tends to quiet down around 1030-11. Rooms were very clean with a big hot shower, and the beds were very comfy. Highly recommend this accommodation!',\n",
       "  'This is a nice hostel with two incredibly friendly hosts, Cristian and his partner. The rooms that we (my husband and I) stayed in were comfortable, clean and well presented. It’s not right in the centre, but Antigua isn’t huge so I didn’t find this a big problem. In less than ten minutes - if that - you’re in the main square. My husband’s Spanish school was just down the road too.   The breakfast is free and really nice: you have the option of three pancakes with syrup (which I’d describe as American in style), or scrambled eggs with a tasty black pean purée and bread (my favourite of the two). You also get free coffee and orange juice. Great value! The WiFi is strong too.   There’s a table tennis table and there are games such as jenga and playing cards.   The hosts gave us',\n",
       "  \"This place has a remarkably relaxed environment which matches the city's chilled vibe. We found this place just after new years and used it as base while we went and hiked the volcanoes. What made this place exceptional was the staff, headed by a gentleman named Christian. The service felt more like a hotel then a hostel with a great complimentary breakfast where they even catered to specific requests.Christian who owns the place couldn't have been more helpful. He was remarkably busy as it was close to new years but always took time to answer our questions and go a step further and offer help where he could. There are some people who do nice things because they want a trip advisor review and there are genuine people. He and his staff were genuine and a pleasure to stay with.\",\n",

A great upstairs terrace area and the best kitchen of any hostel I've stayed at. Only downside is the terrace closes at 9pm, but with such a great location there's ample bars etc within a few minutes' walk. Highly recommended. \",\n",

The property is well maintained with a cosy courtyard for breakfast and a rooftop with spectacular views (you can catch sunset). The wifi worked well throughout the place. Our room was a double on the second floor, away from the street noise and reasonably quiet at night. The staff was super friendly and attentive.\",\n",
       "  'What a great find! On the main drag between the arch and the main square, is this tiny gem. Our room was clean and comfortable, and we loved the common space. The breakfasts were the best we had in a week in Guatemala! And Maria even came early one day to make us breakfast before an early departure. The hosts were pleasant and accommodating and willing to make recommendations. The only challenge was evening noise on the outside room; the inside ones are quieter. But there is no way to get this location without some noise, and for us the location was perfect. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!',\n",
       "  'We stayed at this small but comfortable hotel. We had an easy way to make reservations; we got reminders periodically too. We were welcomed with hot Guatemalan chocolate and cake. The room was convenient and clean. Breakfast was very good and the personnel friendly and accommodating. We were pleasantly surprised to find this hotel close to the center of town that was also excellent value. I would highly recommend it to those traveling on a budget.',\n",

All hotels around here have there quirks and this on is no exception pipes are noisy and there is not glass in the windows that can be quite annoying when a gentleman from Texas decides to take a 5am phone call and stand out side of your room. But that being said the hotel and its court yards are absolutely amazing.',\n",
       "  'I stayed at Hotel Meson de Maria my first night in Antigua and wish that I would have stayed longer! I moved on to another hotel in the area and was disappointed compared to Meson de Maria and I paid more for that hotel. Do yourself a favor and stay longer. I will next time I am in Antigua! The decor, courtyards, rooftop terrace are adorable. There is a peaceful vibe and the breakfast is a perfect assortment.',\n",
       "  \"Pros: Friendly and lovely owners and staffs, perfect location, clean and comfortable room, lovely terrace, great hangout area at the front, delicious breakfast and all the food, tasteful coffee and beer. The only cons: mosquitos which I don't think any of us can avoid. I was so lucky to meet all these wonderful people in Antigua Guatemala. Also, so blessed that the weather was not bad at all during the stay. These staffs in this B&B are just like our family. They are lovely, caring and let you feel welcoming. I think this is the true meaning of hospitality. There are a lot of great things about this B&B and just cannot put them into words. I will just say, I will stay there if I go to Antigua again. If you stay there, have any questions about any arrangement or services, just\",\n",

For two days we had to leave the hotel at 6 am and had breakfast included, so the hotel provided a breakfast at that time, made by the doorman. Very sweet and charming!  Rooms are a bit different from each other. Check that!  Staff (apart from owners, that are there as staff too) are not \"prepared\" not good enough, and dont know how to solve problems. This might obviously change.',\n",

The room had a nice balcony view with bathroom inside, always kept clean with fresh towels.  The breakfast was delicious, simple and satisfying which you can have right on the nice court yard with a view of the mountain.

Being an old restored Spanish-style house, it's possible to access to a central courtyard with good ventilation, at least from some rooms. The service is very good and the breakfast too. However, some aspects are not good, for example the outside noise, because the hotel is very close to the street and the external noises of public transportation are heard from early in the morning. I also heard every day a cock crowing at 5 am, but that was rather funny for me. While the rooms are big, the bathrooms are small and the shower is very uncomfortable. Wifi signal is only regular.\",\n",

There is a guard at night and you will have to show them the key to get back into the room, the guard doesn't speak as much English but is still quite nice. There is also a kitchen, a sitting room with dozens of books to read (mostly dated, many different languages, some are regional guide books), multiple sunny outdoor patios, and a pay per use internet cafe. Our room also had a TV, I didn't use it though. Not a luxury hotel but definitely an adequate base of operations.\",\n",

The only drawback is they do not serve any breakfast but coffee is made at 7am.  Centainly a worthwhile stay......\",\n",

They also provide a very ample and delicious breakfast with veggie omelet, beans, fruit, coffee and bread with jam served by incredibly friendly, hard working ladies in a leafy floral garden, with hammocks, that perfectly frames Agua Volcano. Who could ask for more.',\n",

The hostel is very clean, all day long the sweet staff is cleaning rooms, bathrooms and floors. We used the shared bathrooms which were sufficient. Best part about Casa Jacaranda is the nice breakfast in the garden. The food and the coffee were awesome and a nice start for a long day!

It’s surprisingly quiet at night given the central location. The service was excellent and the breakfast at Don Diego’s Cafe (included free) was delicious.

It was also a bit loud from upstairs and reception. That said, it was a good deal, it is quite lovely inside, the staff were great, it had free water and the included breakfast at Don Diego is one of my favs in town. So all in all it was a good stay.

They didn\\'t even get mad at me for making coffee in the general area–I wake up at 5 am–using our bag of grounds every morning. We had WiFi issues, but not the hotel\\'s fault. I tested their speeds at 8-9 Mbps, but it would drop to 0 intermittently, indefinitely. It seemed, the whole town was that way. Had I needed the WiFi for work, it would have been a problem.

Unfortunately, breakfasts were not offered at all. Hotel staff recommended me a partner restaurant near Arco de Santa Catarina.

       "  \"Think it was run by a Californian family, the boy that was on reception was very cute and appeared to run the whole hostel in a very organised, professional and efficient manner. He was welcoming, attentive and helpful - a credit to the hostel. The rooms were clean and came with fluffy blankets which was a nice addition. Advertised as hot showers but we didn't have a hot one during our stay - not sure why? The free breakfast included is great. The pancakes were large and very tasty. If you want a different breakfast or to add or remove something from your dish they are very accommodating. Best free coffee served during breakfast too!! The wifi works really well and it's only a short 5 min walk into the Central Park and 900metres away from the lookout so great spot. \",\n",

They are special people, and the Hostal is a special place.  The atmosphere is quite, relaxing, and incredibly welcoming.  People from all walks of life and geographies sit around in the evening and share stories.  THE FIRE PIT ROCKS!  Also - the food is outstanding.  Talk with Christian about making one of his famous pizzas or enjoy more traditional Guatemalan dishes.  If you are looking for a place for you, you and your special someone or your famly - this is it.  Fun, but not crazy.  Energetic, but not over the top!  Hostal Antigueno is the perfect combination of energy and quite relaxation.',\n",

The rooms (we took a two-bedroom) are really authentic and everything like shower or TV worked.  Moreover, the staff and also the owner Christian personally are very open and willing to help when you have any problems. In our case we had some health issues where he found a good doctor and also spend hours of time helping us with some language barriers there.   All in all, we enjoyed our time in Antigua, also because of this hostel.   Safe travels everyone. ',\n",

Everything about this place oozed with hospitality from the incredibly warm staff to the candles lit in the living room every night to the plates of cookies laid out in the evenings for the guests. We had the good luck of getting placed in room 7 which was behind the living room, across a little stone bridge over a small pond. It gave the feeling of being in a cottage with its exposed beam ceiling and vintage furniture. The use of the amenities of their sister hotel across the street is awesome, but the little plunge pool in the courtyard of Casa Encantada is also a great place for a quick cool down.   Breakfast on the roof',\n",

But every person that worked the front desk greeted me by name every time I saw them, which is something you don’t normally get. The hotel also has a sister property up the street and all guests at Casa Encantada can use their facilities (pools, retaurants etc.)  I’ve read other reviews that complain about how noisy it is. And it’s true you do hear noise coming from the street. But I also stayed at a higher end hotel during my trip and had the same problem. Noise is just normal here. If you need complete silence when you sleep then I would suggest bringing earplugs.   Thanks Casa Encantada.',\n",

It was great for a family of 4. It is close to the centre, yet quiet at night. We also had use of the kitchen if we wanted and a washing machine (25Q for a wash and 25Q for the dryer).

The spa was amazing and I convinced my family to all get massages which they stated were one of the best they ever had.  The spa was gorgeous with huge hot tubs and a private pool for the spa attendees.  I would definitely stay here again especially for a romantic getaway as the property was gorgeous with the volcanoes as a beautiful backdrop.',\n",

The hotel is also a museum which is an amazing additional facility as walking through the hotel is truly fascinating. The staff is very kind, although less than 50% speaks basic English.

Our friends had their wedding in the on-site church, with a cocktail reception in the courtyard and the reception in the convention center.  Everything was just AMAZING!

Fresh juice, all sorts of fresh fruit, tea, coffee, choice of cereals, eggs/frijoles/platano all to order, decent bread and tasty jams. Wonderful.

The breakfast buffet was also very tasty - but the best food was his wife's almond croissants - best I've had outside of Europe. The room was clean and well maintained and the roof was great for sitting and reading to just enjoy the beautiful weather. Finally, the location is perfect!

Close to central square (1-1/2 blocks). Convenient to most everything else.',\n",

The rooms are cozy and clean, the roof provides an amazing view of the volcanoes, and Irma cooked us a great breakfast each morning. The people at the hotel don't speak much english though, so make sure you're with someone who can communicate. Overall, Irma went above and beyond to make sure we were enjoying our time in Antigua by informing us of tours, places to shop, and events happening around town.

The location is convenient, a short walk to the Central Park, the market and bus station, and all the shops, restaurants and attractions but just far anough away from the town center to avoid all the weekend chaos.  But best of all is the proprietor, Irma. She always serves a wonderful breakfast, is always happy to make arrangements for cabs and pickup at the airport, etc.; no matter what it is, she takes care of it for me.

The ONLY downside is the bar next door.  We didn't have trouble sleeping, but you need to be able to sleep through a heavy bass beat and bar noise that lasts from 7 pm until 1 am.

The staff are very pleasant and helpful, most also speak excellent English especially the desk staff.  I agree with other reviewers regarding hearing everything in your room so if guests are holding conversations at 3 in the morning as they are leaving you can hear everything.

The staff is very friendly and helpful. I’d go back anytime to my suite. One suggestion, TV cable service is very bad! Not that you want to watch tv, but sometimes it is nice to just rest and watch a movie.  Other than that, nothing to be changed!  Thanks for a nice holiday.',\n",

The hotel is located within an easy walk of Antigua’s main plaza and the city’s cultural attractions and many fine restaurants. As noted in other reviews, Casa Encantada is owned by the large Hotel Porta around the corner where you can enjoy the pool and take breakfast there too for a change of scenery. Although the Porta is a nice hotel we much preferred the charm and small cozy boutique hotel atmosphere of the Casa Encantada.  I do want to praise the staff at Casa',\n",

Her breakfasts are delicious and she even packed bags for us when we left too early for breakfast there.

Perfectly positioned in town.  And it is an old home, which is one of the many reasons it's so wonderful in atmosphere, but that means it isn't soundproof.  If you need soundproof in that area of the world something recently built is necessary.  Though we only ever heard noise from inside the hotel.  There is no street noise at all.  It was a brilliant week and we were sorry to leave.\",\n",

I also so loved being able to walk around free wee museums to kill time and take in culture as I pleased. I also loved how close the hotel is to the main square and lots of activities. Extremely accommodating staff, and I loved the free coffee in the morning and ESPECIALLY in the afternoon. ',\n",

Older TV's could be upgraded or removed but had full cable TV. We had a 2nd floor room w/some views of the surrounding volcanos/central park/surrounding buildings. Nothing in town is above a couple stories high and the architecture is a treat to enjoy throughout the city.

The only downside to our room was that the shower would not drain properly causing a very distinct sewage odor. In a small room and bathroom, this is not ideal.\",\n",

We arrived at 1 AM after a long delay and I had arranged a shuttle through the hotel from GC airport. I changed the arrival time about three times during the trip. Sure enough, our driver was there and we arrived safely at the hotel. Same for my daughter who arrived the next day.

While the casa is a good distance from downtown Antigua, it is easy to reach by taxi, and Lucia was more than happy to drop us off and pick us up each day in the Parque Central in her own car, across from the Metropolitan Cathedral.  Lucia was also gracious enough to drive us to the market on market day with her friend Nancy, and we learned SO much about Guatemalan culture and cuisine.

The staff were very friendly and polite.   The only two minor issues were with the water (somewhat difficult to regulate the shower temperature, although we had the same issue at most of the places we stayed, but for this slightly pricier place, we expected a bit better) and the two rooms we got were rather dark (however, this seems to be typical in Antigua and indeed throughout Guatemala).

A short walk the other way to an ATM, the Central Park, and a place we love for morning coffee, The Bagel Barn, a big gringo gathering spot because of good wifi. A block from the Park is Mono Loco, another gringo favorite because you can watch any sporting event. If it's televised anywhere they have it.

When you enter, you pass a nicely decorated hallway to the back of the house, where the rooms of the older part of the hotel are located (and where the manager’s family lives). From there, through an inconspicuous door, you reach a wonderful patio and the newer part of the hotel. We stayed in the suite of “Los Encuentros” over Christmas and New Year for a total of 15 nights. This suite is basically a two-room penthouse on top of the otherwise single-storied hotel, and can be reached via two (quite narrow) spiral staircases.

A fully equipped kitchen is at the disposal of guests.

The 3rd story is a great view of the volcanoes.  Rooms are small but clean and mattresses pretty good.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Tip: if you stay here they do not have screens in the windows; no problem though there are not a lot of bugs.  You will have a light curtain to keep this curtain closed bring a safety pin or a barrette will do in a pinch. We spent the last two nights there because we knew what to expect, no surprises\",\n",

She was able to answer any questions we had about the area and set up shuttles for any activities that we decided to do. The free wifi didn't work in our room but it worked well in the public areas. The complementary breakfast was always filling and something different every morning. we also found that the location of los Encuentros was fairly central (it only took five minutes to walk most places) which made it much easier to get around. As two 20 year old girls there were times in Antigua that we didn't feel completely safe but we always felt secure while at Los Encuentros. If I ever get back to Antigua\",\n",

Hotel Los Encuentros is very safe and feels super cozy! Location is fantastic, near La Merced church. I highly recommend staying here. Price was a little higher than other hotels I looked at but definitely worth it!!!',\n",

From the moment we arrived until we left someone was always there to help us make arrangements for travel and to provide us with a safe and clean place to stay.  Irma's breakfasts were always better than anything we could have found in a restaurant, fresh and tasty. I'm going to keep this place in my list of hotels for my next trip to Antigua.\",\n",

The squash purée was sweet and the fish was perfectly done . Many at our table also enjoyed pasta which was a large amount .

If you closed the shutters however, the room was very dark. Maybe the rooms upstairs are better. The bed sheets were old and looked worn and they did not fit the double mattresses.

We were in bed and asleep at 10:00 pm and awaken to the sound of a car backing into the downstairs court yard and they noise was loud enough to sound like we were sleeping in the garage. \",\n",

Lots of really positive stuff about the resort - gym is good, pool area is great for kids as is the playground. Deluxe garden room was recently renovated and very smart. Dinner at the restaurant was very good. Most of the staff were also lovely and very friendly and helpful. Relaxed vibe.  The negative stuff - mainly hinged around our reception experiences to be honest. We arrived at 830pm, one guy on reception and a large wedding party taking place so probably a bit stressed. However, he wasn't very welcoming, was quite dismissive and just wanted to get me to sign various paperwork, give us the key and send us on our way.

As far as the negatives, parking was a nightmare, since they do not have own parking and we were sent to a sketchy place. The parking attendant seemed confused as to which hotel we were coming from, and he did not tell us that other cars would be blocking our exit. It ended up working out well. Also, bathrooms are very small, as there is no place to put down your toiletries bag. Finally, the street the hotel is on does have heavy traffic at times (I was there on a weekend).',\n",

She told us to look for other accommodations.  We asked her to cancel our reservation and to not charge our card and she said she would cancel it. We stayed the night at another hotel, but our card still got charged. So, we went back and asked to get our money back because we didn't stay there. We couldn't get a refund.

Fast internet. But very small TV with no english channels. No refrigerator in the room, and no safe, so I had to visit the city taking the passport and money with me. Privacy was also in question.

Breakfast was ok, and parking is not on site but 2.5 blocks away wasn't so inconvenient. You can walk to the central square in 10-15 min.

It was the first time I considered using my sleeping bag inner to sleep in the bed during my entire stay in Guatemala. The staff offered no solution to the problems. Antigua is walkable where you stay, so the location is not at all relevant. Definitely stay elsewhere to get much better value for money and stay clean',\n",

The room was small but came with an ensuite with daily housekeeping, a hot shower and cable TV. A Breakfast is worth about GTQ25 ... so the room was excellent value at GTQ121 but IT IS NOT worth the Rack Rate of GTQ380 / night that it is listed for. It is worth about GTQ175 / night including Breakfast. The hosts were nice people and it had a comfy common area.

Morning tea was fine but any other was undrinkable as the manager either couldn’t or wouldn’t provide hot water. Maybe it was a lack of English but that is also not good enough for the front desk.

It felt clean and secure and was right in the thick of things in Antigua. We were able to spend a whole day exploring on foot.   Like everywhere else in Central America, the beds were harder than what we are used to in the US. However, you are not going to get fancy, imported, fluffy, foreign beds for this price. Sheets were clean and towels were provided.  We used the airport transfer, which was SUCH a convenience. The staff helped us book our bus to Atitlan, and they were able to watch our bags in the time between check out and our bus pick-up. There is a small courtyard in which to sit and drink beer',\n",

The worst part is that we requested the wake-up call for a morning shuttle to the airport 3 times, because they seemed arrogant and confused.  They didn't wake-us up!  This is the first time this has ever happened to me.  When I told the front office person, she told me to write complaint forms and it wasn't her fault because it was in a book that she showed me.

We were on the first floor and it was very noisy at night; not sure if it was staff, fellow guests or street noise.

The return to one small hotel room could bias my perception of it.  It was not anything special for the price we paid.  We had reserved ahead of time because I had my wife and two youngest daughters and did not want to be looking for a place with them in tow.

Any noise echoes in the interior of the hotel, so be aware. It's like that in most colonial hotels. I found it a bad value for the money $35/night. No coffee or food available.

A few things to consider when booking this hotel:  - it's 4-5km to Antigua city centre: one can easily take a bus during the day (for Q3) but at night you'd have to take a taxi which will cost $5-7 per person! There's no courtesy taxi anymore as someone said in previous comments. I wouldn't advise you to walk there at night either...  - breakfast isn't great considering what you pay for the room: you get concentrated orange juice, coffee and a plate consisting of some scrambled eggs, frijoles, slice of papaya and watermelon. Pretty basic for £70 a night in Guatemala!  - if you're planning a visit to one of the volcanos or a\",\n",

I order room service for breakfast and was willing to pay for it even though that our expenses covered the breakfast at the restaurante. They did not charge for taking my breakfast to the room .   Other activities that we had in the hotel  , where excepcional since they have gorgeous outdoor spaces  . I recommend Santo Domingo not only as a tourist but to have Seminars or forums because they have the capacity in managing small and big groups. ',\n",

The only complaint is minor and just needed to be mentioned to someone.The location of the hotel seemed safe and secure and the room was excellent. \",\n",

The grounds are lovely, and our room was well appointed and very very clean (be sure to get one with a window, patio or balcony). Be sure to take advantage of visiting the onsite museums and ruins.  The staff is very very friendly and service oriented. Food was good, but they need some more \"casual\" options at dinner. The property was expensive by Guatemala standards, but coming from the US, affordable luxury.  We also visited the restaurant and museum at Santo Domingo del Cerro, up the hill from the hotel and had a delicious breakfast and enjoyed wonderful art installations. ',\n",

It is located very conveniently close to the famous yellow Arch in Antigua and just down one block from the town square, shopping, banking and restaurants. You can't tell from the outside, but this small hotel has a beautiful courtyard with blooming plants, greenery and a pool. There is also a covered breakfast area that became our gathering place in the morning mostly because they had free coffee and cold water. Fortunately, our room was upstairs above the breakfast area. Even though there are stairs to haul your suitcases up and down, try to reserve room 10, 11 or 12. Those rooms have a balcony that you can watch Volcano Fuego erupt every night!

Two blocks close to the Arch, a few blocks close to Central Park and best a bunch of restaurants. Breakfast was delicious. Overall, I had a good stay. One suggestion....

I was on the second floor so if you have a heavy bag this could be a little difficult. The room had a comfortable bed, tv, bathroom, and a great view. The whole hotel area is a big garden.

Breakfast was very limited (scrambled egss, beans and one type of white cheese). But good value ',\n",

While most of the staff spoke little English the manager who was present each day was fluent.  The manager gave us information on tours and shops.  Breakfast was relatively simple but good.  Our room was not very large but was well outfitted and the bed was comfortable.  We had no issues with hot water (there was plenty).Ask for a second floor room, they have  view of Fuego ( an active volcano).   There were no negatives during our 4 night stay.

My room was also gorgeous- every detail was beautiful. Even the doors were carved with a floral design. The staff is very helpful.  The less good things: I got about 90 seconds of hot water for 2 out of 3 showers. There was neither a/c nor a fan.  Merely irritating things: the front door is locked, so every time you come back to the hotel, you have to knock and hope someone heard you. Also, it's a little ways from the central part of town, but it's a small town, so that's only about 10-15 minutes of walking.\",\n",

King sized bed was comfortable and actually big enough for my 6'3'' boyfriend to fit in. WiFi signal strength in rooms was strong. Location was great. Within walking distance from the central park and the walk home late at night never felt un-safe. The staff was incredibly friendly and always willing to help with directions and/or advice.

Keep this in mind with flights, as I missed one of mine.  ',\n",

It's quaint, quiet and relaxing but you also have access to the larger resort across the street so can enjoy some additional amenities like restaurant, bar and pool (but Casa Encantada also has a pool!). The room was small but we never spend much time in the room when exploring a new city so that doesn't matter. It was well decorated and comfortable. The staff were all very friendly as well! The breakfast on the rooftop was also delicious and it was so nice to soak up the sun on the rooftop every morning. You can pretty much walk all of Antigua so the location is perfect and not on a super busy street. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Antigua!\",\n",

Breakfast was provided each morning which was good. Being from Canada, it was a little bit pricey because of the exchange but they have no control over that. Don’t forget to include the 22% tax on the posted rate which we forgot about. However, our room had no curtain in the bathroom so we were unable to leave the window open while we were showering which resulted in the room being very humid and steamy. Additionally the roll up blind in the bedroom was broken which reduced the amount of fresh air coming into the room.

The only negative, was the lack of light into the unit, mostly dark and lights on for most of the time. The courtyard is very small and not user friendly.  The Condo/hotel unit is a good 10 to 15 minute walk from the town square and an additional 10 minutes to the supermarket. We walked everywhere and never felt unsafe in and around Antigua.

The owners and staff were always available and very helpful.  It's on a busy road, but the rooms are tucked away in back so noise was not a problem.  It is not fancy, but I think it's perfect for the budget traveler:  quiet, clean, decent location at a great price with friendly owners.\",\n",
       " 'We booked one night in Antigua so wanted it to be special. Visiting during Holy Week we wanted to be sure to see the procession over the flower petal murals. Casa Buena Vista was perfect as the procession went right past the front of the hotel!  The location is perfect for exploring the city as well. It’s a great place from which to launch a walking circuit of all the sites in the city and is very close to a square where a (cooked) food market bustles at night. Plenty of tiendas for essentials like wine and snacks too.   As for the property, it is just lovely. Pass through a locked gate to a gorgeous small colonial courtyard with a small fountain. There is also a rooftop where we sipped wine before dinner.   We were in room 3 and my suggestion would be to avoid rooms 1 thru 3.',\n",

The morning breakfast was homemade every day with attention to detail.   The staff was on 24-7 to make sure we had everything we could possibly need.   They were friendly and proactive.   The hotel is nicely located on a quiet street  near the Antigua Arch.   I felt like a family member by the time I left.   They were very helpful setting up our excursion up the Picaya Volcano.',\n",

The breakfast included was amazing. We had the typical Guatemalan breakfast and it was so good!  Great service, great bread, beautiful dining room - It made our stay extra special!   One suggestion would be a water cooler in room. The two small bottles provided were not enough. They were very willing to fill up our water bottles in the kitchen but you had to track someone down each time.   Definitely would stay here again!  We were a family of 4 and Room was comfortable for all! ',\n",

This cozy, beautiful, well maintained hotel was such a pleasure to be at. What tops that is the excellent service that we received from the friendly staff that were so eager to assist at anytime. They helped us with whatever we needed and answered all our questions. The daily breakfast is served to order and in a room next to the kitchen with five tables. Although the choices are limited to either the traditional eggs, beans, cheese and fried plantains or the pancake and fruits platter, it was something that we looked forward to and enjoyed. Both are served with coffee and juice. Eggs are cooked to order the way you like.',\n",

The bathroom was pretty cool, tiles are like rocks, feels your are in a waterfall, although is missing a bit of an air outlet.  It has a parking lot just behind it (with a private entrance to the hotel), for 50Q will keep your car the whole day.- Remember to book your space in advance.  It has a nice location (not to near to the Santa Catalina Gate but perfect to walk). Staff was extra friendly and ready to help.   It has a nice patio that was lit up at night. Very dreamy.

It seems that many stay in the South West of Antigua where McDonald's and Subway were located, but I am glad that we stayed in the opposite side of the city, where it was quiet. We walked all over the town - even the main market was about 15 - 17 minutes on foot.  We had to go to the bank in the Central Park a couple of times, but it was within ten minutes.  Breakfast (included) consists of 2 eggs, black beans, fried plantains, and 2 roles (and coffee or juice).  We had to leave early twice, so we had breakfast 3 times at its lovely dining area.  Very satisfying.  When people have dinner in the courtyard, the noise comes right into your room, but normally they leave by 9 PM.  2 bottles of water replenished daily. \",\n",

Great central location (nothing is more than a 10 minute walk), beautiful and comfortable rooms, very friendly staff, amazing garden where you can have a delicious breakfast. I stayed in room 1 where my favourite part was the shower. It was just like a mini hamam topped with a skylight.

They serve coffee from a local farm, and it was the best coffee I’ve ever had, and the homemade jam was to die for. Although the hotel is in the middle of everything and a few steps from the Arco, the property is super quiet.

From the moment we checked in we knew that we were in for a special experience.  We asked for a quiet room – we were situated on an upper floor at the end of a short corridor so there was no passing foot traffic.  The room itself was spacious and tastefully furnished.  The bathroom had a large enclosed bath with a shower over – again plenty of room.  It was reassuring to have a large safe to secure our valuables.  The breakfast buffet was plentiful and varied – lots of fresh fruit, pastries and breads and eggs cooked fresh to order.  The wait staff were attentive and friendly.  We also ate dinner in the restaurant – the food was of a uniformly high quality',\n",

The facility is spotless, the backyard immaculate for breakfasts and the rooftop terrace has a fantastic 360 degree view of the volcanoes surrounding Antigua.

That said, like many hotels in Antigua, you don’t want to open your window to the street (most rooms) as the noise continues well into the night.  Antigua has become one big hotel; I doubt that anyone actually lives there anymore.

The staff were warm and friendly. There was free water and tea/coffee on tap which we hadn't found in the more expensive hotels.

The other receptionist did not speak English. She was on duty when we checked out so I was unable to resolve the $100 overcharge on our bill until I returned home.

Next door is El Barrio a traditional complex with 5 different bars. Mind that if you stay in room 15 that you will hear some faint music till around midnight. After that it’s quiet. In the other rooms I guess you are fine. We didn’t mind it, at all, it even gave some charm, guess we are city people :)',\n",

The restaurant and bar provide a great atmosphere and quality meals and the massages at the spa are wonderful. Everywhere we wanted to explore in Antigua was in walking distance, too.

In fact, to call it a hotel is in part a disservice, because that belies the beauty and history that pervades every corner of the expansive property. It’s like staying in an ancient ruins yet with the comfort and service of today. Surprises abound, including thousands of flickering candles nightly, to fresh coffee and pastry discreetly placed in each hallway nook each morning.  The employees are top notch as well, from the initial bell stand interaction, to reception, restaurant, gym, housekeeping, security...you get the picture. All for less money than I would have expected.  I would return to Antigua again, in large part to stay here',\n",

Someone pointed out earlier that their slusing door wouldn't lock.  We found this to be true in our unit as well.  I ended up using the dustpan handle as a door lock, which worked alright.

The hotel was clean and comfortable it was great to have the courtyard as a place to meet up with the other members of our family. Just a couple of issues we had. Our room was located next to the stairs to the rooftop so we had a lot of traffic right outside our room. Since the window in our bathroom was right there we had to keep it closed for privacy reasons. It was difficult to get a good airflow in the room. WiFi is only one router in the courtyard. It worked well enough for me, but I was SUPER patient. The hotel is only 1 1/2 blocks from the Central Park and the cathedral. It was a fantastic location. Many carpets were created in front of the hotel and a couple of the processions went in front of the',\n",

There is also a rooftop terrace that has the most amazing views of Antigua, the volcanoes, everything! The only disappointment was that the booking website we used advertised a pool, and there is none.  Guests can use a pool at another hotel for a fee, but they could have disclosed that.  Overall a great stay.',\n",

Shower a little underpowered but suffice.  Very nice roof  terrace with perfect view of volcano aqua, fuego and acanetengo.  Shared kitchen that’s well equipped; a nice lady who spoke English which is always so helpful if you are a dufus like me.  WiFi ok, occasionally drops out. Not high speed, though.  Overall, I’d recommend as the location is excellent with some benefits of sister hotels nearby added.',\n",

Here is the deal...it deserves 5 stars because of its potential and its abundant  character but will not get 5 stars because one has to sacrifice certain creature comforts like AC (it has fans) and older restrooms. But this was one of the oldest buildings in Antigua! The ceilings are like staying in a museum...just stunning. The beds are just what you need and the entire staff is fantastic.  Excellent location.  I could not recommend this hotel night. Especially for larger parties that can book in advance several of their rooms. The courtyard is beautiful and quaint. ',\n",

My only complaint is that we did not have any hot water over the 3 nights we stayed at this property.

Not a big issue given that it was pretty warm outside when we stayed, but want to point out the issue.',\n",

I highly recommend spending some time in Antigua Guatemala, so close to Guatemala City and in my own opinion, the most beautiful city in the world. We stayed at El Marques de Antigua. It is kind of a townhouse complex where you can rent individual units. We decided for this place because it is located just 4 blocks from the Central Park and several restaurants with all types of food. Our experience was much better than staying in a hotel. The units are fully furnished in a real \"Antigua style\", price is extremely affordable, and service is excellent. A great way (and maybe the only way) to experience Antigua Guatemala!',\n",

Definitely recommended, you get your money's worth.\",\n",

You get your own apartment really, it's fully equipped with all the conveniences of your own home and all for the same or less amount of cost than that of a regular hotel room.  The only cons I found are its location, it is a bit far from the center of antigua only because you have to walk everywhere and it rains alot. The other con is noise control. You can hear everything that goes on outside or next door and viceversa. But I still give this place an overall 5 star rating for its value and amenities. This is the place I'd come to stay anytime.\",\n",

This time I wanted to stay in Antigua and did some looking online to see what was available with a fireplace.   I found El Marques and recently stayed for 3 nights.   Tourists must keep in mind that Antigua is a colonial city, you will not see signs over hanging the streets, the properties have names on them and this is how you locate them.  Although we entered Antigua during the night we were able to find El Marques quite easily, when we drove up the security guard checked a list to make sure we were on it before opening the gates to allow us to enter.  My office manager had made the reservations because he speaks Spanish but we were greeted by Ms. Lopez herself who speaks English',\n",

The courtyard is lit with candles at night, and it such a peaceful place to rest after a day of sightseeing.   We (2 couples) stayed in rooms 2 and 3.

Breakfasts are an experience; small tables are positioned around the inner courtyard with foundations and beautifully kept grounds, as well as individually ordered and well prepared food; croissants equal to Paris, fresh squeezed orange juice, etc. The hotel is spotlessly clean and lovingly cared for. My only complaint is that the room that I was in (#3) had a bit of a musty smell, I believe from the Persian carpets placed on the tile, which often happens in humid environments; they might want to do a different carpet',\n",

Warm shower only at low water pressure. Average breakfast (chapin, traditional).  If you want to take a shuttle you should know that it's more than probable that you'll be the first in the bus. Great, you can choose your seat... In return be prepared for 30min cobbled road ride to collect all the passengers from other hotels. If you are late, they'll probably come back in 30 mins ;)\",\n",

We had a taxi booked in the middle of the night on our 4th night, and the owners kindly let us leave bags with them all day and nap on their couch until it arrived so we didn't have to pay for an extra night.

The fireworks were right above us from their rooftop terrace. The owner and help couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating.  The breakfasts were wonderful, the ambience wonderful.  Can't say enough good things about this place.  Right down the street from El Arco and the Plaza.  Our room was on the main street, but double-paned windows kept any noise barely noticeable.\",\n",

Most of the processions passed in front of the hotel and we had two rooms on the second floor, each with a balcony to enjoy an expectacular view.  My advice is to reserve early to get these rooms.  The rooms were clean and the showers had hot water. The Staff were very attentive and they took care of washing our clothes. Rafa, the owner, was very pleasant and helpful in arranging our transportation back to the airport and also offered some tapas for snacks.  The breakfast was delicious and served in the patio, where you meet other guests.  I will definitely stay here again.  One of many nice features of this hotel is that is in the center of town and a few steps from the Central',\n",
       " 'Casa Del Arco is an well located small hotel with outstanding service and unbeatable ambience. It hits that sweet spot between backpackers \"crib\" and inclusive hotel. If economy is your greatest concern or you want a contrived resort experience, this may not be your fit. If you enjoy accommodation that allows you  interaction with  your host and an attentive but small staff in an attractive environment, this is an excellent choice.  ',\n",

As Posada offered this option and had availability - I booked - it was a GREAT DECISION.  The airport arrival can be overwhelming with the many taxi drivers lurking, and hoards of people waiting to welcome their family members. Our driver has a big clear sign and was an absolute delight!   The drive to Antigua is around 45 mins from the airport. We were thankful to have the hotel transfer as if you're not familiar with where you are, the dark drive can be daunting.  The receptionist was helpful and quick to respond on emails. The room\",\n",

I would stay here again. Rooms are small and basic but perfect as we didn't spend much time there. Something to note is the hot water isn't instant. Have to turn the handle slowly and wait for a while. Found out the second day there. And if hot, you just need to ask for a fan. \",\n",

Hot water, tv, safe, great location, beautiful courtyard and terrace, and even a kitchen! Only complaint is that sound echos when people talk in the courtyard to every room on the first floor, so I recommend asking for a room on the second floor. Great deal in Antigua!',\n",

A perfect spot if traveling with car and kids and it\\'s \"under the volcano Agua\"!!!',\n",

They even let us leave our bags here free of charge when we did the overnight Acatenango hike.  There is a kitchen present (not very common around here) and they do laundry relatively cheaply, or you can wash your clothes by hand and they have a drying line on the rooftop terrace. Every room is either lockable or they have lockers in the dorms, so all your valuables can stay safe.  A tip: if you take a bottom bunk in the dorm, you get privacy curtains :D They were fully booked on Halloween night so we unfortunately had to stay at another hostel for that night, but we came back and were welcomed like old friends.  There are also the two of the cutest',\n",

Most valuable asset of the place is Cindy (the host); she is super friendly and helpful and she knows Antigua very well!',\n",

There were quite a few mosquitos outside the room but only a couple managed to get in - but that's pretty standard.  One thing to note - as other reviewers have mentioned it was pretty noisy. The hotel courtyard opens on to the street it was really noisy and early -like around 5 am in the morning. I still think it was good for the price!\",\n",

We booked a quad room and were pleasantly surprised that the room was 2 double beds, with a loft that had 2 twin beds...perfect!  It gave the teens a space that was there own.  The hotel is just blocks away from Park Central and close to the arch, as well.  It is a very well located hotel.   The hotel has a beautiful courtyard with a lovely fountain and each night around 5:30-6:00 o'clock the birds would arrive and serenade us.   The only drawback was that there wasn't always hot water.

It is very clean and well kept. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I wasn’t crazy about my first room- it was filled with mosquitos and very dark. The shower was odd and made me feel uncomfortable, but it was my fault for not complaining about it. I dealt with it for two nights being that I wasn’t there for the hotel, I was there to explore the area. I left Antigua for a week to embark on the mission trip and at the end, returned to Antigua to stay here another night. I was given a different room which was much better! Better lighting, better shower. There is a rooftop area to can visit',\n",

Coffee and tea or cold water is available at all times and the courtyard and garden are filled with fountains, birds, flowers and an ongoing feast to the eyes of interesting decor and furniture pieces. The room was lovely and the special touch's like the face cloth folded like a swan did not go unnoticed. Perfect location to walk everywhere, Very impressed and would not hesitate recommending it.\",\n",

Everything was outstanding--in fact, the best we have ever experienced--and both of us have traveled extensively, which is to say we are evaluating the hotel against many other accommodations in many other places. This time, we traveled with our one year old daughter, to whom the staff was very accommodating.  All staff members were very helpful (almost entirely in Spanish, but many were also apparently quite comfortable speaking a small amount of English). We did not catch all of the names but Nelson (a bell hop) and Jorge (food/room service) were particularly kind and helped us feel at home.',\n",

The second night we cured the bed problem, by stacking the second mattress on top of the first mattress and slept very good.',\n",

Friendly and helpful staff. Restaurant was a little more expensive than restaurants in town which are approx 20-30 mins walk away down Antigua's iconic cobbled streets. Slightly irritated that the hotel charges for bottled drinking water on the rooms and as previously noted some rooms on the exterior of the courtyarded garden suffer from road noise. Small bathing pool to ease those aching legs after a hard day sightseeing \",\n",
       " 'I went on a conference/retreat at Villa Colonial. I was impressed that the hotel is only 20 years old, but it feels architecturally like it was built 200 years ago. It is a twenty minute walk to the plaza which I liked because we were close enough to go, but far enough away to feel more secluded. The food was amazing. The staff was always professional and attentive. The rooms are simple, yet always well maintained. When I say simple, I do not imply it lacks any modern conveniences. A good Latin hotel will have a hot shower, tiled floors and a comfortable and cable TV. I would stay here again in a heart-beat!',\n",

It's a bit of a walk from the city center (far NE corner of the area where most tourists roam), but definitely not an issue.  Christian and his staff were very accommodating and a pleasure to talk to.  Since part of the hotel is set up like a hostel, there is no shortage of conversation in the outside common area with interesting guests.  I enjoyed watching a local artist paint wall murals near the bunk rooms.  There's also a beautiful garden near the private rooms, and you can catch a nap outside easily if so inclined.  My only issue was I had a bit of trouble keeping warm in the room at night, and would say that the rooms might not be as well insulated as you would expect when the temperature gets down\",\n",

The terrace was a great place to relax and enjoy breakfast, the sunshine, relax, and/or read.  Everyone was so nice. We were always greeted with a smile. The hotel is convenient to the center of the city. They also can plan spa's at the much more expensive hotel across the street. So even though they did not have their own spa, it was almost better as we did not have to pay the higher hotel prices. Also, if your into yoga, there is a great studio\",\n",

From the rooms it’s really easy to hear people next door and bells ring nearby at 5am but it’s an old building so it’s all part of the ‘charm’.  From the roof you can see the volcano spewing its smoke at times. The hotel is in a good location with easy access to all the main sites.  We thought there was a bar downstairs but there wasn’t.

The food in the pleasantly sized restaurant on the upper level is superb; perfect portions, great taste, and filling just enough. The maids always clean the rooms in a timely manner and do the sweetest little things like folding the clothes and towels that were left on the floor. The best part of the hotel is the open roof which you can see from the lobby; some rooms have balconies so you can look up and see the sky.

With all the knick-knacks around it could also be a museum. The quirky intermingling of Mezoamerican artifacts and photos of European cities is strange; depending on how you look at it you may consider it charming or annoying.  My room was above average size and comfortable although there was only one somewhat easy chair, and no sofa, so two people would have some difficulties when it came to relaxation. The bathroom was adequate and it had hot water in the shower without having bare wiring',\n",

We were offered a cooked, or continental breakfast (which is included in the rate) and ate on their very pretty patio.   We heard no noise from other rooms and my only gripe would be that the bedrooms need more illumination. Hopefully they could do that tastefully without breaking up the colonial decor.   If you are considering this property, be aware that they have a sister hotel called the Palacio Chico 1940, so don't book the wrong hotel. Don’t know why this property sits so low in the TA listings, it is a good option for travelers\",\n",
       " 'We stayed here on our final night in Antigua the staff could not have been nicer they answered loads of questions for us and sorted an airport shuttle. The room was spotless and the shuttered windows ensured a solid nights rest. It is a little expensive for what you get in terms of breakfast which was only 2 pieces of toast, 2 small slices of watermelon and pineapple. We asked for eggs which they gave.   Bottled water was free and it is in a nice quiet area of the town. ',\n",

If location is your primary concern, this may not be your best option. I would still give this place 5 stars because of the helpfulness of the staff.   We arrived in the evening and had a 4am shuttle to Honduras the next day so our time here was limited, but the staff were so friendly and ordered a Chinese delivery (Restaurante Mulan) for us for dinner. The room was also comfortable and the shower was a perfect temperature - important after a few days in the Guatemalan highlands where the water was lukewarm at best! This place was ideal for a short stay.',\n",

The hotel del Marques features exclusively suites, we booked a large suite for 6 persons equipped with a kitchen,  and a washer & dryer all of which proved very useful!  The beds were new and very comfy, even the sofa-bed seemed good quality (my kids slept in it, not me though) The hotel is quiet, we couldn't hear any of the other guests, however the design of the suite is such that you'll hear from the bedroom located\",\n",

The breakfast was great as well.',\n",

Large grounds with exotic plants and a swimming pool at the far end with lounge chairs. You walk through a small court yard and then there are the rooms. Very modern bathrooms and very clean.  Excellent beds and everything is clean. The hotel looks like it could have been a Spanish Estate and then turned into a hotel. I had dinner there and breakfast. Excellent food and attentive restaurant staff. The restaurant looks over the garden area, nice touch. Its about a 15 minute walk to the town. This is a very pleasant walk past old churches and lots of old buildings and shops. What a beautiful town. It looks like they dropped a Spanish city in Guatemala.',\n",

Good snacks and service in small bar/restaurant. Adequate breakfast and nice views to active volcano in distance. Lovely kept gardens with a lovely small but warm swimming pool at the far end. Walking distance to town.\",\n",
       " 'I stayed for two nights with my family in late December.  The hotel setting (grounds, buildings, ambiance) is five stars and amazing.  Kudos to the hotel for improving the museums, which are really interesting and worth a visit whether or not you stay at this hotel.  However, the food and room were not too impressive- three stars.  The room smelled smoky as there was a fireplace and a little card that instructed people not to have fires... well, then maybe you should take out the wood of the fireplace so that people do not light fires!  We had two meals at the hotel- an average breakfast with very slow service and sandwiches at the pool, which were not very good. All in all, an enjoyable 2 days, but the hotel could do better.',\n",

Room was clean and staff were all very friendly! My kids loved the turn down service and finding the chocolate mints and daily newsletter on the bed. The hotel is also a museum so there is a lot to walk around and see on your own. We also enjoyed the heated pool on Christmas day. Would come back and stay here again for sure! ',\n",

The rooms are spacious and clean, comfy beds, fireplaces in each room which was a treat, good water pressure in the shower. The staff is helpful and the property itself is gorgeous having left many of the original walls from the monastery. They've done an incredible job with the grounds full of plants and even parrots who hang out in the courtyards during the day. The restaurant is good but expensive for Antigua (as is to be expected with a hotel restaurant). I highly recommend staying here!\",\n",

As soon as you walk in, you understand that you are somewhere special, especially when you walk in at night. Almost mysterious, the candles, the sculptures, the patina, the history, a choice of music. It is like a museum where you were allowed to sleep. Staff is really great and friendly, however some of them did not speak English too well and it is strange given it is a 5 star hotel. On the same note the restaurant's staff is also very kind and really trying their best, but we had to wait for some silly things, that in theory shouldn't happen to a 5 star property. However, given it is Guatemala, we were totally OK with that. Apart\",\n",

The courtyard within the hotel is beautiful and its landscape ; simple and yet stunning , making us feel right at home. It’s just great to be able to chill at the courtyard sipping coffee or a beer.  The staffs are all friendly and very helpful, passionate and knowledgeable. The staff helped us booked most of our activities at great prices and we are so grateful for all the tips. The rooms are big, simple and yet functional . Hot water is available but can take a few minutes to flow through the shower, so a little of patience help.  Overall this is a nice place to stay, and i would recommend checking it out.',\n",

I would say the location, a little bit away is better to have a tranquil night. The hotel itself does not show all the beauty from the outside. There is a big wood door that is kept closed all day and night. But inside you will be presented by a huge garden very well taken care of. There is no parking. People are very attentive and always smiling. The room is very comfy, good bed, small tv that I did not try. In my room (19) there was 2 queen beds. My only complain is the shower, difficult to get to a constant water temperature. Sometimes too hot, sometimes colder. But nothing that bothered too much. I do',\n",
       " 'This is a lovely small hotel, associated with at least 2 other hotels in Antigua.  Guests can use the amenities of the other hotels, including meals, swimming pool and gym in the other hotels at no additional charge.  My room, while quite lovely, was directly on a noisy street.  I innocently asked if my room could be changed. The receptionist not only worked to change my room, but went the extra distance to see if I could be relocated to the other hotel.  This meant that I was upgraded to a much more luxurious room, at no additional charge.  This is what I call true customer service!  I ate several meals at the hotel--the Porta--including sumptuous breakfast buffets as two dinners, which were all exceptional.  A delightful experience, all in all.',\n",

Breakfast on the beautifully landscaped roof terrace was delicious and served with great charm by Augustine. Tea, coffee and small cakes were available in the lounge 24 hours a day. We really appreciated this.   Our room (no 1) was small, quiet, comfortable and very well equipped but we would have liked a bit more shelf space for our belongings. The bathroom was large with an enormous shower area.  The hotel is conveniently situated, quite close to the Parque Central and it always felt safe walking to restaurants at night.  We would thoroughly recommend this wonderful place.',\n",

I would definitely recommend this hotel. Thanks for a nice stay!',\n",

Maria on reception is fantastic and organised Spanish lessons for me with an awesome  private tutor that I had at the hostel.   The location is awesome. A 30 second walk to the square and loads of nice resteraunts and bars. It's not a very sociable hostel (but then I was staying in a private room).However because it is so close to lots of sociable bars (particularly the snug/ travel menu) this wasn't a problem.\",\n",

The other staff aren’t as fluent but we were still able to get everything across that we needed.   The property is great. The hostal has its own garden and courtyard where you can just sit and relax and enjoy your free time.

Staff/owners are lovely and very welcoming and helpful with information about the town, tours, hikes and shuttles/transfers...large resident dog is super sweet and friendly.

The shower was really good - always a big plus for us.  Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is served in the beautiful courtyard full of ferns and flowers, which can be a bit chilly  (my follically challenged companion had to wear his woolly hat!) but we were told there was an unusually cold front coming through!  Not a huge choice of food, but the fruit was excellent, and the traditional breakfast of eggs, plantain, salsa and refried beans was nice.

Our breakfast was included and consisted of pancakes, potatoes, yogurt & fruit. We had booked a double deluxe room and requested a quiet room and were placed on the second level in the back of hotel (room 208), which was perfect for us. Keep in mind there are no elevators here.

Thank you!  All the staff at Casa Del Arco are extremely friendly and helpful. A very helpful lady checked us in. On our departure day, even though it was 330am, a staff  was already awake and all ready to help me with my luggage.  Excellent wifi. Best we had in our 2 weeks in  Belize and Guatemala.  Hearty breakfast. I love the freshly squeezed OJ.  I love the terrace with comfortable couches where I spent my afternoons',\n",

As we wandered into the b&b after 11 days of travel through the Yucatan and parts of Guatemala, our Agentinian host welcomed us with a greeting and a smile and helped us settle into marvelous spacious accommodations of solid wood,Guatemalan woven material, and sunlight. Throughout our stay he and his friendly staff truly made us feel at home and were helpful in every way.    There are four other reasons that I highly recommend Casa del Arco.  First of all, its second floor terrace with its hammock, swinging chair, sitting area and breakfasts-an excellent location to regroup after a day of exploration. Secondly, its bar and grill with a good selection of beers, tastey tapas, and awesome Agentinian sausage',\n",

The swimming pool is very clean and HEATED, which was great bonus since the temperatures where quite moderate in January. The staff of the hotel was amazingly welcoming, friendly and helpful. Thank you!!! Complimentary tea and coffee served 24 hrs is very nice. The staff even let us use the kitchen to prepare breakfast, which was also very nice. On our last day we decided to order breakfast in the hotel and it was very tasty, too. No restaurant, but there are many around. Right next door there is El Pinque - great place with nice local, atmosphere and HUGE portions of food for a reasonable price.',\n",

I then left my credit card in the taxi and the hotel called and had it back for me in the morning!!  Coffee was wonderful.  Pool and gardens looked wonderful but was so busy we didn't get a chance to try it out.  Room was large and full of character.  I love interesting, different places and this was one of my favorites.  Would definitely stay again.  Also great access to city center.\",\n",

It is a quiet oasis very close to the centre. The staff are the strong point and both the owner and the receptionists looked after me and were extremely kind, helpful and friendly. The rooms are clean, simple and comfortable, the wifi is a bit patchy but that is typical for Antigua. Breakfast is simple of toast, jam and fruit. It is good value for money and I would recommend this place to anyone for a traditional Antigua house to stay in. ',\n",

The rooftop patio was amazing at night for viewing the volcano and the lights of Antigua. I can’t wait to go back!',\n",

The entrance is authentic, with a patio and a fountain in the middle, and nice tables to catch the midday sun. It was a lovely surprise for us to discover the rooftop terrace and view on our last day, where we caught the sunset and a panoramic view of Antigua. Perfect for a couple of minutes of reading time or simply enjoying the time.   The hotel does not offer breakfast included, but you may request it. I recommend a delicious place less than a block away called Doña Luisa, where you’ll get both typical breakfast and international options.   The location is perfect, only a few blocks from the cathedral. Either way,',\n",

The rooftop sitting area offers a great view of town and the volcanoes. There aren't fridges in the rooms, but it was better to have the use of the communal kitchen, I think. When our ride to Guatemala City fell through, the staff found us another within 15 minutes. We felt very safe staying here, as well. Wifi worked fine.\",\n",

Hot shower, wifi was good, the desk clerk girl was very sweet and helpful. Very reasonably priced, and close to the center. The only critique is that the man who let us in around 10pm had obviously been drinking, not very professional. It's not necessarily our first pick but we would go back. \",\n",

There's hot water all day and clean towels everyday if you need.  The kitchenette was fully equipped, which made it easy to fix light meals instead of getting takeout everyday.  All restaurants and a small supermarket are within walking distance.  The only downside...if party noise bothers you, not the base place to catch the best night sleep.  Since is so close to it all in Antigua main restaurants, the arch and parque central, you will catch the noise off the parties.  Mostly 'til 3am 😴😴 Other than that, we will be staying here the next second round to finish our Guatemala tour. 😉\",\n",

You can get better value by booking directly with the hotel so maybe bypass the online bookings.  the ladies at reception were welcoming and helpful, I enjoyed my stay.  They don't provide breakfast but there are many places along the road or in the town square, I guess that is what a posada is about...\",\n",

The room was excellent - clean and comfortable with reliable hot water.  They have a terrace with fantastic views of Antigua as well.  The breakfast was very good with a variety of choices.  The location is perfect, right next to the Merced church and very close to the famous Catalina Arch.  Wifi is in the lobby or on the terrace.  The terrace has chairs and a sit down area to work if necessary.  When catching my shuttle back to Guatemala City the young man at the front desk even carried my bag and guided me to the meeting point down the alley to catch my shuttle which was clearly over and above',\n",

The beds and pillows comfortable, great WiFi, hot water, free drinking water, free coffee and tea. Beer for sale in cooler, cheap price. Nice courtyard and a top terrace with great views. Very secure. The best though is the staff was very friendly and helpful. The only down side, is that the terrace needs new cushions for chairs and to be more inviting, so much potential there. We would definitely stay there again. Oh ya and they store your stuff for you if you are coming back as we did after spending a week at Lago de Atitlan.',\n",

If we go again to Guatemala we will stay again in Uxlabil at Guatemala City, Antigua and Atitlan. ',\n",
       " 'We stayed for 2 nights - Friday & Saturday. The hotel was great, the staff were very helpful, breakfast is now on site and was good.

Sunday morning - 5:30am, 5:45am & 6:00am.  So if you are an early riser this place is just perfect. If not, you may need to stay further from the centre.',\n",

Especially given that we were hiking, biking, and kayaking, I would prefer somewhere with a pool or hot tub.   The room was clean and comfortable.  Clean bath towels daily, but only one hand towel and one wash cloth for 3 people.   The package had us away for two nights out of the week. The hotel staff charged $1 per bag for storage, which is ridiculous. They coordinate with the tour operator for the cost of the room, and knew we would be out for two separate nights, and still charged us. The menat the front desk were apologetic.  The woman was prickly and borderline rude. I told them we would pay all charges at checkout, but they asked for the',\n",

To sit upstairs and be able to see Volcan de Fuego erupting was a real treat.   The staff are incredibly friendly and professional, the only downside being beers are extremely overpriced, so buy them from a corner store.  The rooms are clean, comfortable and there is a laundry service at the hotel (also very expensive compared to local rates)',\n",
       " 'Stayed here on two occasions and in both cases it was a perfect base in Antigua. The suites are about 5 blocks from the central square of Antigua - walking along cobbled streets. Its in a quiet part of town with all rooms on two levels surrounding a very pleasant internal courtyard. The roof top is large and has some seating and tables - great for some late night drinks looking at the volcano under the stars. The rooms are reasonable size with good facilities - a great shower and bed. We did not have breakfast included so went out each morning (there are some great options nearby. The property does not have a restaurant. The reception seems to be manned 24/7 and sold a small range of essentials and drinks. The property fees very secure with a door that is locked late evening.

       " 'Our United States mission team stayed at this hotel earlier this month for one night after being in the mission field south of Mazatenango. The description says it is two blocks south of the central park square, but it is almost a four block walk.  The main door is kept locked at all times, and you have to ring a bell for entry. We all felt very safe there, and we found the rooms to be quaint and clean. The proximity to the park square makes it easy to enjoy the sights and dining in Antigua.',\n",
       " 'My boyfriend and I stayed here for 5 nights (3 before a tour and 2 with a tour). The hotel was very clean, the terrace was lovely and staff were friendly and helpful. The place seemed quite secure as the front doors were locked at all times and you had to buzz to get in. We originally had a room by the roadside and it was a bit noisy in the early morning, but we were able to change rooms given it was low season. The hot water works, but requires a bit of patience. Bottled water provided daily was appreciated. The location was good - walking distance to Parque Central and Caobo Farm. Overall, a good hotel and we had a comfortable stay.',\n",
       " 'The hotel is nice, the beds are not comfortable but the pillows are. It has a lovely garden in the center with tables for you to drink tea or coffee.  It is pet friendly, they don’t charge anything extra for your pet and they give you a little bed for them.   Bathroom inside the room and a little TV. The hotel isn’t quiet, the noise starts around 5am and that kept our puppy up since.  If you call the hotel they’ll give you a cheaper price than if you book your trip online (around Q200 or $20 cheaper)',\n",

Our room was very dark, but made for good sleeping! The roof deck was beautiful, views of the volcanos and city. Delicious, fresh breakfast was served every morning and Irma allowed us to use the kitchen when we needed it.  Great place for a longer stay or with a family as it was very quiet, safe and off the main drag of the city.',\n",

The care taken to maintain the grounds was equally astonishing. The plants provided a wonderful garden feeling.  But the details were what really impressed. Everywhere there were antiquities on display. Candles lit the grounds at night. The furnishing scattered around the hotel all were worth looking at closely. We had the breakfast buffet which included crepes, an omelet station, tamales, and much more.  All and all our stay was just excellent. It definitely is in our top 5 hotels. Thank you for everything.',\n",

This place is a one stop shop for anything you might need on a vacation. A great pool, nice spa, a chocolate shop, A sushi bar inside of a late night bar,and ruins on the property visible from the pool as you enjoy poolside service. Definitely worth a visit if you aren’t staying here but if you can stay here it’s a must!',\n",

The service was incredible, the food was delicious, and our room was beautiful. We stayed in the Suite that had access to the patio, and it was so lovely eating breakfast there every morning. It had a beautiful view of the flowers and the hills surrounding Antigua. The concierge was so helpful with suggesting activities to do in Antigua. It is such a quaint boutique hotel that has access to everything at Porta Hotel, so you're not missing any of the amenities! I love Casa Encantada and wholeheartedly recommend it! \",\n",

Casa Encantada feels intimate and romantic, it\\'s located a couple of block away from the center and just around the corner from the large hotel Porta in case you want to make use of the heated pool and spa. The suite is was spacious and beautifully decorated, we made use of the hot tub and the chimney twice and had breakfast on the terrace while enjoying the beautiful views. We were able to use the terrace during our \"getting ready\"',\n",

We were greeted within 30 seconds by the Owner/Operator named Christian, and he is the nicest guy in town. The atmosphere of the Hostel was definitely more relaxed the first night (Thursday), and the crowd picked up for the Friday/Saturday nights. However, it’s definitely NOT a typical “party“ Hostel. They do have a wide selection of cheap and delicious beers, and it’s a great vibe for hanging out but we always got a great night sleep as it tends to quiet down around 1030-11. Rooms were very clean with a big hot shower, and the beds were very comfy. Highly recommend this accommodation!',\n",

It’s not right in the centre, but Antigua isn’t huge so I didn’t find this a big problem. In less than ten minutes - if that - you’re in the main square. My husband’s Spanish school was just down the road too.   The breakfast is free and really nice: you have the option of three pancakes with syrup (which I’d describe as American in style), or scrambled eggs with a tasty black pean purée and bread (my favourite of the two). You also get free coffee and orange juice. Great value! The WiFi is strong too.   There’s a table tennis table and there are games such as jenga and playing cards.   The hosts gave us',\n",

What made this place exceptional was the staff, headed by a gentleman named Christian. The service felt more like a hotel then a hostel with a great complimentary breakfast where they even catered to specific requests.Christian who owns the place couldn't have been more helpful. He was remarkably busy as it was close to new years but always took time to answer our questions and go a step further and offer help where he could. There are some people who do nice things because they want a trip advisor review and there are genuine people. He and his staff were genuine and a pleasure to stay with.\",\n",

Also, so blessed that the weather was not bad at all during the stay. These staffs in this B&B are just like our family. They are lovely, caring and let you feel welcoming. I think this is the true meaning of hospitality. There are a lot of great things about this B&B and just cannot put them into words. I will just say, I will stay there if I go to Antigua again.

However, some aspects are not good, for example the outside noise, because the hotel is very close to the street and the external noises of public transportation are heard from early in the morning.

The cost is reasonable, it is clean and safe.  If we return to Antigua we will return to Posada San Sebastián.',\n",

Pros: location, staff, views, price for the money  Cons: pool water is cold, bathroom is weird, location... if you need to relax maybe this is not for you on weekend cause next door are some bars that have some noise till midnight.',\n",

They also provide a very ample and delicious breakfast with veggie omelet, beans, fruit, coffee and bread with jam served by incredibly friendly, hard working ladies in a leafy floral garden, with hammocks, that perfectly frames Agua Volcano. Who could ask for more.',\n",

Make sure and get a room on the top floor as I hear they are much brighter and quieter. The location couldn’t be better. Excellent restaurants, shops, sights nearby. It’s surprisingly quiet at night given the central location. The service was excellent and the breakfast at Don Diego’s Cafe (included free) was delicious.

I tested their speeds at 8-9 Mbps, but it would drop to 0 intermittently, indefinitely. It seemed, the whole town was that way. Had I needed the WiFi for work, it would have been a problem.

Unfortunately, breakfasts were not offered at all. Hotel staff recommended me a partner restaurant near Arco de Santa Catarina.

I stayed her for 2 nights and I had the chance to be part of the Open Mic which was wonderful, lovely vibe and people happy and signing. Prices are absolutely great, from many options on rates for the rooms to good prices at their bar, oh and the bar staff... LEGENDS.

Advertised as hot showers but we didn't have a hot one during our stay - not sure why? The free breakfast included is great. The pancakes were large and very tasty. If you want a different breakfast or to add or remove something from your dish they are very accommodating. Best free coffee served during breakfast too!!

People from all walks of life and geographies sit around in the evening and share stories.  THE FIRE PIT ROCKS!  Also - the food is outstanding.  Talk with Christian about making one of his famous pizzas or enjoy more traditional Guatemalan dishes.  If you are looking for a place for you, you and your special someone or your famly - this is it.  Fun, but not crazy.  Energetic, but not over the top!

In our case we had some health issues where he found a good doctor and also spend hours of time helping us with some language barriers there.

We had the good luck of getting placed in room 7 which was behind the living room, across a little stone bridge over a small pond. It gave the feeling of being in a cottage with its exposed beam ceiling and vintage furniture.

The hotel also has a sister property up the street and all guests at Casa Encantada can use their facilities (pools, retaurants etc.)  I’ve read other reviews that complain about how noisy it is. And it’s true you do hear noise coming from the street. But I also stayed at a higher end hotel during my trip and had the same problem. Noise is just normal here. If you need complete silence when you sleep then I would suggest bringing earplugs.   Thanks Casa Encantada.',\n",

My favorite thing about this hotel is the rooftop terrace - The 360 views of the volcanoes are amazing. Agua, Fuego and Acatenango are easily visible (if the weather is clear) and there is a nice view of Saint Joseph Cathedral as well.

The rooms are big with high ceilings, there is a large patio with a lovely garden in the middle of the building. You can sit in one of the hammocks and spend some relaxed time. See picture. Service was great. Two thumbs up! A great value for the price.',\n",

It is within a short waling distance to Parque Central and has a very friendly, well-spoken (English and Spanish) and helpful staff.   I'd put their hospitality at the top of any hotel/accommodation that I've been to.  The staff answered many questions that I had and if they didn't know the answer, they looked it up online or made a phone call - very smart indeed!  Most places anywhere won't go through that much trouble.  Casi and the rest of the staff have a great command of English and again, were very helpful.  There's a nice kitchen to cook or store food and a nice garden area to eat.  I was fortunate to have enough time to relax on their beautiful couch in the lounge to read.   The outside courtyard looked nice.  I\",\n",

The bathroom was also small but clean; the water was hot.  There was a room safe and cable television.  The hotel is quiet and has a kitchen and salon.  It is about four blocks from Parque Central and one block from the market.  We stayed in four Antigua hotels over five nights and this was the best one for the price.',\n",

Lounge area and second floor deck were very tranquil for studying and relaxing.  Very convenient and close to central park and McDonald's. Friendly and courteous staff.  Used their laundry service and they did an excellent job for a reasonable fee. We normally stay at one of their other properties Hotel Casa Antigua that I also highly recommend.  It has a beautiful garden and more rustic old world feel, which we love.\",\n",

It was perfect for us - the complimentary breakfast at the cafe was delicious, the wifi was strong and they provide filtered drinking water (very appreciated when you're traveling!). The hotel itself is in a restored historical building that is very special - a lot of interesting colonial details and decorated with antique furniture and art from local artists. It's across the street from the La Merced church and less than 10 minutes to the central park. Tons of restaurants and shops nearby. The staff are all so friendly and the beds are comfy... we would absolutely stay here again.\",\n",

Room was basic, but clean and had everything we needed. Quiet too! In the morning we spent some time on the rooftop patio, which is gorgeous. Would be a great place to chill in the daytime. Free coffee, tea and water available, and good internet access.   They also arranged our airport pickup from Guatemala City - everything went smoothly.',\n",

       " 'The facilities were great, sheets changed and bathrooms cleaned everyday, and in general the hostel was very clean. The best thing for me was the atmosphere though; on the day the hostel was very peaceful with hammocks to chill in and a common area for socializing, and most nights there was a group continuing the night from the reasonably priced bar to another place. So, whichever you look for, you should find it here at 3 monkeys. No free breakfast, but coffee as much as you like thorough the day  I ended up extending my first stay. and then came back after visiting Lake Atitilan for a week. Beautiful hostel run by the most amazing people!',\n",
       " 'The hostel staff are great and are always willing to help with requests, booking tours and shuttles etc. I would strongly recommend that you book the Acatenango hike through the hostel as it is proved to be professionally done. There is free water and coffee 24/7 and a nice few communal areas as well as a fully functioning kitchen and bar. The rooms are large and have plenty of storage space and the beds all have an individual light and are comfortable.',\n",
       " 'We stayed here for a few nights and had a fantastic time! The staff were very friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. The rooftop chillout area is the perfect place to enjoy the free coffee while looking out at a number of volcanoes. The bar area was a great place to meet other travelers and indulge in some cheap drinks.  Overall, this is one of my favourite hostels.',\n",
       " \"We had a pleasant stay here because of the following: Very comfortable beds and good night's sleep. Attractive communal areas including a pretty garden. Good breakfast included that you can enjoy every morning in said garden. Generally happy and pleasant staff. Good security measures with the front entrance having a friendly young lad on the door evenings/early mornings. Erm... Guess that's it... Quite a few good things though, eh?\",\n",
       " \"on first look Jacaranda doesnt look like much as the rooms are quite basic. but the place is really clean - there were always cleaners around- and the price is great especially when you consider that a freshly made breakfast is included. its also got very good security throughout the night which is important in Antigua. the showers take a while to heat up but if you persevere you can get hot water! its good for couples or people travelling not looking to socialise, although if you're looking for a hostel vibe i wouldn't recommend it.\",\n",

       " 'I stayed a couple of nights in this hostel at the beginning of my trip in Guatemala, and decided to stop there again before leaving the country. It is a quiet place and the staff was always very nice and helpful. I had a small single room (maybe the illumination can be improved) and the shared bathroom was clean and comfortable. In the morning you can choose among a few types of breakfast, which was good. There is a nice garden in the back of the hostel.',\n",

The  resulting room was a bit larger, the bathroom an improvement (tub), the courtyard lovely, the nonstop coffee and drinking water very welcome (especially after doing without for a few days in Pana), rooftop, gardens, all as described.  They also made a couple of phone calls for me (topic exceeded my high school Spanish) and helped retrieve a battered old (but loved) bathing suit I left elsewhere.  Above and beyond.  A little book exchange was nice also, I left one and brought one home (an old paperback mystery) and I like having this little souvenir on my\",\n",
       " \"This great little economical hotel has nicely decorated, clean and comfortable rooms. The bathroom was roomy and hot water was reliable in the shower. The grounds have lovely flowers, tables and chairs and a friendly parrot. They serve an optional breakfast with fresh fruit, eggs, pancakes, potatoes and terrific coffee. The hotel is a short walk to the plaza on a quiet side street. The staff was bilingual, friendly and helpful. The only downside was that the windows in the newer rooms do not close tightly  leaving a gap that lets in mosquitos. We learned that the staff is aware and will give you masking tape to tape over the gap, however, we didn't learn this until the day we left (with a few bites as souvenirs). But, even with that, we would stay there again. Very pleasant\",\n",

We did not build in Antigua but did stay for a number of days prior. I was impressed. The staff are knowledgeable and friendly. They don't get in your face but look after you. No food here but it's a very quiet spot to rest your weary feet after a day roaming around. And they helped quite a bit in arranging excursions   The only down side is the cost of the shuttle. Don't use their shuttle. Get one from Guatemala City. Much cheaper. \",\n",

The courtyard is by far the best part of this place. The grounds are so well kept, it's unreal. The large windows in the rooms open up completely and you get wonderful views and fresh air.   The receptionist is bilingual, which is helpful. They offer free, unlimited purified water, fast wifi in the rooms, and inexpensive laundry service. You can also get decent breakfast delivered to your room for $6 USD.   There is also a terrace on the second floor with lounge chairs with nice views.   The hotel is conveniently located, just a short walk to the main square and many restaurants.   We loved Antigua\",\n",

Rooms large. Only annoying thing is that you have to knock or rung the bell whenever you want to get into the hotel which means we were woken up late and early as you can hear it in your room.pick a room on a higher floor on the other side of the courtyard ',\n",
       " 'I stayed here recently for a few nights. The location is good, just four blocks away from the main plaza. The courtyard area and rooftop are nice and the rooms were spacious and clean. You need to leave the shower running for a good five minutes before it starts to warm up though! The breakfasts were nice and reasonably priced. Staff were also friendly but didn’t understand much English. WiFi worked quite well. Overall decent enough hotel.',\n",

       " 'This place looks not much from the outside, but when you enter it has a beautiful centre courtyard.  All the rooms come off the centre, it can be noisy if there are people in the courtyard as the noise travels upwards.  If you have room backing onto the road, this can too be noisy with local traffic on the cobbled roads.  Breakfast is on the roof with a great view to volcanoes, which you can see them puffing smoke.  Close location to the centre of town, with good restaurants also close by.',\n",
       " 'This hotel is located an easy 10 minute walk from the city center which makes it a nice quiet place from traffic. The view from the roof of the hotel where you have breakfast is fantastic. You can choose from a menu which free breakfast you would like. I ordered pancakes one morning that came with 2 pancakes, 3 different fruit slices, yogurt and granola, it was fantastic!  The staff are very pleasant and helpful, most also speak excellent English especially the desk staff.  I agree with other reviewers regarding hearing everything in your room so if guests are holding conversations at 3 in the morning as they are leaving you can hear everything. You would think that the guests themselves would understand the need to be quiet when they are in the courtyard at night.',\n",

I could see staying here with my wife and two teens easily.  Good price, Wifi, and decent location.',\n",

The hotel is located within an easy walk of Antigua’s main plaza and the city’s cultural attractions and many fine restaurants. As noted in other reviews, Casa Encantada is owned by the large Hotel Porta around the corner where you can enjoy the pool and take breakfast there too for a change of scenery.

Her breakfasts are delicious and she even packed bags for us when we left too early for breakfast there.

Perfectly positioned in town.  And it is an old home, which is one of the many reasons it's so wonderful in atmosphere, but that means it isn't soundproof.  If you need soundproof in that area of the world something recently built is necessary.  Though we only ever heard noise from inside the hotel.  There is no street noise at all.

The rooms are cozy and cute. There is no central A/C (anywhere), but the fans in the room sufficed. Had a huge spider in the room, but that's pretty common for Guatemala. The only downside to our room was that the shower would not drain properly causing a very distinct sewage odor. In a small room and bathroom, this is not ideal.\",\n",

This was perfect for me and three adult children.There is an amazing view out of the room of the volcano (when it's clear.) The pool is beautiful and the front desk staff very helpful. We arrived at 1 AM after a long delay and I had arranged a shuttle through the hotel from GC airport. I changed the arrival time about three times during the trip. Sure enough, our driver was there and we arrived safely at the hotel. Same for my daughter who arrived the next day.

While the casa is a good distance from downtown Antigua, it is easy to reach by taxi, and Lucia was more than happy to drop us off and pick us up each day in the Parque Central in her own car, across from the Metropolitan Cathedral.

The staff were very friendly and polite.   The only two minor issues were with the water (somewhat difficult to regulate the shower temperature, although we had the same issue at most of the places we stayed, but for this slightly pricier place, we expected a bit better) and the two rooms we got were rather dark (however, this seems to be typical in Antigua and indeed throughout Guatemala).

A short walk the other way to an ATM, the Central Park, and a place we love for morning coffee, The Bagel Barn, a big gringo gathering spot because of good wifi.

Big parking spot so if you needed to work on bikes or dry camping gear that would also work.  Big terrace too.  Great for star gazing or the super moon.

The hotel is located two blocks from the main town square and two blocks from the main market (a must see/experience).  The showers have water heaters built into the shower heads so do not run the water at full rate or it won't warm up (it took us a couple of tries to figure that out !).  There is a night club a few doors away that can be noisy on a weekend night but it didn't really bother us.  Be sure to try Mosa beer !!\",\n",

The kitchen is open for anybody to use and it is located in a beautiful quiet courtyard. We were able to warm up the kids milk and feed them some cereal we had with us which save us some money on breakfast outside.  The staff was very nice and didn't give us any problems to check out.  The only thing is that if you get warm at night or need white noise ask for a fan in advance.  I would stay here again!\",\n",

Room 6 is a small room w/ out an exterior window so is more quiet ... pretty room good for single or couple.  Very nice, helpful and cheerful staff.  Breakfast is good ... fresh fruit and they will make coffee for you at any time of day.

On the other hand, since there are a bunch of young people drinking, there are some inconsiderate behaviors ie leaving the kitchen mess, coming back into the room and waking people up, etc. It can be quite loud, especially the dorm rooms by the kitchen/bathroom. The rooftop over the courtyard is a great quiet place to get away for a bit; there are nice views, too. The dorm beds don't have curtains, which is a bummer when people are shining their phone lights everywhere. The dorm beds do have individual lights and outlets though, so that's good.

The room was pretty small, but it was charming. The Guatemalan breakfast was excellent. I had a bit of a problem ordering in dinner (after waiting 90 minutes I realized the staff forgot). They made up for it by comping dessert. Their English was so-so, but no problem, I was in a Spanish speaking country. It's a little farther out from the city than other locations, so in the evenings I was definitely aware of my surroundings. I'd stay here again.\",\n",

We woke up the next morning and Irma had 2 plates set out for us on the table, and served us a great breakfast with good coffee.

Tip: if you stay here they do not have screens in the windows; no problem though there are not a lot of bugs.  You will have a light curtain to keep this curtain closed bring a safety pin or a barrette will do in a pinch. We spent the last two nights there because we knew what to expect, no surprises\",\n",

The hotel grounds was very peaceful, quiet and comfortable. In recent trips, I've been pampered with business travel, so this was a pleasant surprise..almost like I was camping.

A pesar de la expectativa por visitar Antigua decidimos pasar solo una noche y destinar dos noches en Panajachel, decisión  que estuvo muy bien porque tuvimos prácticamente todo un día para recorrer sus calles, ruinas y lugares emblemáticos. Siendo solo una noche optamos por un lugar económico y que nos ofreciera una cama y un baño decente, así fuese sin desayuno incluido y la elección por apartamentos Morelia no pudo ser mejor.. El lugar nos pareció muy completo y muy económico; simplemente supero nuestras expectativas. Apartamentos Morelia se trata de una grande y bonita casona blanca que cuenta con habitaciones básicas y agradables: camas cómodas con buenos edredones y almohadas, un buen armario donde',\n",

Con- here there were no blankets on the bed and it got cold. Also the dorm has 3 bunks squashed in but there are only 3 lockers? It can be noisy with the female bathroom right next door. Wifi is weak past the main entrance until you go out to the garden. Garden was nice but Yellow House's courtyard and rooftop was nicer and staff were more helpful.  YH'a breakfast is better, you're not charged to put milk in your coffee! I also got charged more than 80Q for my bed even though the price on HostelWorld was quoted as $12. You have to pay a refundable key deposit which made it confusing.\",\n",

The backyard is very relaxing. And at night, the hostel is very secure.',\n",

I enjoyed my breakfast every morning either directly in the inner courtyard or on the terrace in combination with an amazing view on the huge volcanoes nearby. For me as a motorcycle traveller it was a big advantage that I could store my bike directly in the hallway of the hotel. There it was stored save and dry. Because the hotel rooms are only equipped with the most simple windows (which are standard in every other hotel in Antigua as well) it can be a bit noisy in your room when people gather together in the',\n",

Well done 3 Monkeys for finding such excellent young volunteers.   Hostels may strike you as a place only for younger generations but 3 Monkeys really changed my perceptions. I will not only definitely be coming back to 3 Monkeys but I will look at hostels differently wherever i go from now on.',\n",

The staff is extremely helpful, the rooms are comfortable and nicely furnished, the breakfast on the rooftop terrace is very good, and the hotel is maybe a five-minute walk to the heart of the old town. There is a bit of noise from the street traffic during daylight hours, but nothing during the night. Highly recommended!',\n",

The hotel is a \"sister\" of Hotel Porta, another exceptional hotel. You could enjoy the facilities and breakfast buffet there.  The pool was clean, and it was nice to sit by the poolside and enjoy the garden.',\n",

There was no safe but the bathroom was clean and there was a small walk in closet. It did take a few minutes for the hot water to come through in the shower which did not sit well with us. The breakfast on the roof top terrace was lovely and the service is very good. The WIFI worked well in the room and entrance courtyard. The El Carmen is located a few blocks from the main square. We would definitely stay at the suites again.',\n",
       " 'The plus is this Hotel is very centrally located to the main Plaza in Antigua is about a 10 minute walk.

The rooms are clean and relatively big and could accommodate up to 4 beds. Hotel is not in the town center but it is only 5-10 minute walk from the plaza which made it relatively accessible to all attractions and restaurants. 2 small tips: 1. Don't get a street side room if you're a light sleeper. (On our first night we felt we are literally sleeping on the street ... and after relocated to one of the internal rooms it was very quiet)  2. Not many vegan options in Breakfast (although the views on the roof are amazing)\",\n",

Someone in my group left her phone there and they found it right after we left. They took the time to get on their motor bike and catch up to our bus. And someone in my group also needed to go to the hospital and they made sure we had a ride there.  Beautiful place. I would highly recommend staying here. They also have really good homemade cookies! :)',\n",

The owner, Christian, speaks brilliant English if you have trouble with Spanish at times. When you're there, they won't hesitate to help you with anything.

The complementary breakfast was always filling and something different every morning. we also found that the location of los Encuentros was fairly central (it only took five minutes to walk most places) which made it much easier to get around.

       " 'Stayed here for one night before moving to Tropicana (had already booked). I loved this hostel, it’s in a beautiful setting and is a chilled hostel with friendly staff.   It’s not a party hostel but you’ll still meet people here as it’s busy and well designed. I’d recommend. ',\n",
       " 'Relaxed atmosphere in this fine hotel. Very well located to visit the city. Rooms are comfortable and you have an excellent patio to relax. Staff is extremely helpful and nice, ready to answer any question.',\n",
       " 'My girlfriend and I stayed here for two nights and we totally loved it. Our private room was cozy and for breakfast you had the choice between five different menus. As all of them sounded great you had to make a tough decision each morning :) the people at the reception can give you a lot of information and also speak English. ',\n",
       " \"perfect hostel. it's clean, we are fine, the staff are nice, a beautiful functional kitchen. we had a nice stay down there.  the staff gave us good advice and places to go and they are well organized for the Acatenango volcano.  \",\n",
       " 'Lovely place. Relaxed and chilled - lively enough to be a great atmosphere but not a full on party place so allowing those who want to sleep to do do. Staff are are considerate and uber-helpful and it’s the little touches that make the difference- free drinking water, free lockers for those going on trips, free coffee in the morning. A whole range of ages staying, probably cos everyone feels comfortable. I stayed for a couple of nights then came back on 2 separate occasions and was pleased that I did',\n",
       " 'This hostel is excellent if you want relax and chill out after you get back from the volcano tour or strolling the Antigua streets. The hostel has great location close to everything, within 5 to 10 minutes you are at the cathedral, bus station or bank. Bank Rural where you can buy the Tikal entrance is just 2 blocks away. Staff super friendly and providing you with many useful info about the tours, shuttles, point of interest or help you to post the postcards as the post office servis \\xa0in Guatemala is currently terminated, so DHL can post the cards (20 GTQ each). The tours and shuttles can be bought for good price at the reception with the pick up from the hostel.  The hostel is spotlessly clean, the cleaning lady takes great care all day. There is communal kitchen with free',\n",
       " 'Clean hostel with beautiful gardens. Stayed 3 nights and staff were very helpful with booking shuttles, tours and giving us directions around town. Had quiet areas for those who didint want to party and areas where people could drink and be a bit louder.  Would stay again.',\n",
       " \"This hotel has a beautiful courtyard and was very clean.  Plus lovely hot water and decent water pressure.  The only downside was the noise....I think everyone in the hotel can hear people talking in courtyard.  Since I was leaving early, I don't think people were talking late.....just after I was trying to sleep.  Otherwise it was great!\",\n",
       " \"I stayed here a couple of nights, the bed was pretty good, got a good nights sleep. It's a short walk to the main square. I'd stay here again. One thing I would mention is if you want to arrange a shuttle to the airport, do it yourself from one of the travel agents in town. I checked at reception and it was very expensive for the same thing\",\n",
       " 'Spent   10  Nights & 11  Days  with the very  helpful  staff.. @ The Front Desk..Mirza,Melia & Sacky were  delightful..  &  The  3  Wappa  girls  doing  the  Housecleaning,.  Yesenia, Auri, &  Rudilia...made  laugh  with  Joy  so many  times...  They also  gave special  attention to my Puppy Dog  ,  Eldorado,.. a  Mayan Chihuahua- Coyote  mix  from  Lago Atitlan..  &  The Wappo  Gardner  David...was  patient  with the  Pup..for he did dig a few holes... eh eh.. Tks  to that  Lovely Man.. & Of  Course .. Salvador  the Security guard..always the gentleman...  Tks  Everyone...   Rafa  d  Canada.',\n",
       " \"On our recent trip to Guatemala, we stayed at Casa Encantada twice...our first 3 days, and our last day prior to flying home.   Our good friends had highly recommended it, and we were not disappointed.  First of all, the staff are wonderful.  They anticipated our needs, went out of their way to accommodate our late arrival (set us a delicious meal).   The breakfast on the rooftop is excellent.  The venue is charming.    This property is owned by the Porta group, and so you can also take advantage of facilities and services at the grand hotel one block away.  We enjoyed its bar, and we were able to arrange a walking tour with their concierge.  I can't say enough good things about Casa Encantada.  We will definitely stay there, our next time in Antigua!\",\n",
       " 'Cozy and extremely comfortable with just 10 rooms. Sister hotel one block away offers heated pool, gym and restaurant. Located close to all Antigua has to offer. Amazingly friendly and accommodating staff. Breakfast in roof deck in morning is such a treat, for all senses.',\n",
       " 'I would wholeheartedly recommend Casa Encantada and it’s sister Porta hotels in Antigua.  My room was great - very well-equipped and with a super-comfortable queen bed.  All of the staff were so kind and accommodating, treating us like house guests.',\n",

      "We went to the hotel directly to book a room. The receptionist at first gave us a really high price then lowered it. When we asked how much it costs in qetales she gave us an 8.2 comission rate to dollars and I knew she was randomly goving us a non existing rate so then she \"lowered\" it to the real rate. After we agreed that the price includes breakfast the following morning we get to breakfast and received two plain pieces of toast and fruit while theother tables received also eggs and plantines. So I asked if we also get eggs abd plantines and she replied \"no\". How come we didn't get the same breakfast when we paid for it?? Not a good experience at all at the hotel. There are much better places in Antigua to stay.\n",
